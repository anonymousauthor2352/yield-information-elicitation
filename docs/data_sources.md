# Data Sources

## Collections

Collections are sourced from various sources, including the following:

### Oyez Supreme Court

The Supreme Court case collection was sourced from the Oyez repository developed by Cornell's Legal Information Institute, Justia, and Chicago-Kent College of Law.

The Supreme Court hears cases from the first Monday in October until late June or early July (a "term") ([Supreme Court of the United States, 2025](#supreme_court_of_the_united_states_court_2025)). Hence, the "years"" included in the dataset start in October. As of this writing, the last complete term is 2023. While the archive runs from 1955, we only include YIELD in the last 10-year period (2014-2023) to make the dialogue pool in this domain not be overwhelmingly larger than other domains.

### Harvard Dataverse

The Harvard Dataverse Repository is an open-access platform for researchers across disciplines to share research data. The following collections were obtained from this source: Covid Threshold Project Dataverse ([Lachman, 2022](#lachman_interview_2022)), Healthworker Interview Transcripts ([Watkins, 2021](#watkins_healthworker_2021)), Drivers of Food Choice ([Girard, 2019](#girard_dfc_tanzania_2019)), AI feedback: Moving beyond the hype ( [Tay, 2024a](#tay_ai_2024); [Tay, 2024b](#tay_replication_2024)), Relationship Building Around Farmers’ Market Incentive Programs (D.C. Market Manager Relationships) ([Policastro, 2017](#policastro_relationship_2017)), Leaders Leading Organizational Change ([Sadaric, 2022](#sadaric_interviews_2022)), and Biodiversity Offsetting ([Taherzadeh, 2016](#taherzadeh_interview_2016)).

### National Archives and Records Administration

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is the U.S. government agency responsible for preserving and providing access to federal records and historical documents. The following collections were obtained from this source: National Archives History Office Interviews ([The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, 2025](#the_us_national_archives_and_records_administration_national_2025)), National Personnel Records Center Oral History Interviews ([The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, 2023](#the_us_national_archives_and_records_administration_national_2023)), Veterans Oral History Interviews ([The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, 2024b](#the_us_national_archives_and_records_administration_veterans_2024)), and National Archives Assembly's Legacy Project ([The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, 2024a](#the_us_national_archives_and_records_administration_national_2024)).

### JFK Library

NARA manages the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. It offers collections related to John F. Kennedy's life, career, and era, along with his administration's work and its influence on the public. The Returned Peace Corps Volunteer Collection ([The John F. Kennedy Library, 2025](#the_john_f_kennedy_library_returned_2025)) was obtained from this source.

### Johnson Space Center

The NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project ([National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2021](#national_aeronautics_and_space_administration_-_johnson_space_center_oral_2021)) documents the personal experiences of individuals who played vital roles in America’s space programs. Participants include astronauts, engineers, and administrators.

### VOA News

[Voice of America (n.d.)](#voice_of_america_voanewscom_nodate) (VOA) is a U.S. international broadcaster under the U.S. Agency for Global Media, delivering news through digital channels, TV, and radio. Funded by Congress, all VOA content is in the public domain. A subset of the "VOA Interview" series was searched and selected for YIELD.

### Wikinews

[Wikinews (n.d.)](#wikinews_categoryinterviews_nodate) is a collaborative news platform that the Wikimedia Foundation runs. It publishes user-generated reports in multiple languages under a Creative Commons license. YIELD selects a subset of articles from the "Interviews" category.
