Lee, who is known as Dottie to her friends and her colleagues, for the Johnson Space Center Oral History Project at the offices of Signal Corporation in Houston, Texas. Interviewer is Rebecca Wright, assisted by Sandra Johnson and Carol Butler.\\n\\n Thank you again for taking the time to visit with us today. You have contributed to the design and development of spacecraft for all of America's manned space programs. Were your childhood dreams in any way related to what you were able to accomplish as an adult?"

But I read…[George Gamow and other] astrophysicists, and I knew that we were going to go to the moon [when] I was ten years old. That was in 1937. No one outside of \"Buck Rogers\" or what have you had stories of those tales in those days.\\n\\n I was recruited, while in college, to go to work for NACA [National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics], and then it became a reality by virtue of just being at the right place at the right time, which is the story of my life. My entire life has been lucky, and I've always been at the right place at the right time."

I wasn't aware that I was unique, but I haven't met anyone else who read [Gamow] and the rest of them when they were a child. Mother wondered why I liked classical music. I think it worried her. I was so glad that ultimately she loved opera, because I didn't want her to think something was wrong with me.\\n\\n But, no, math was very easy for me, just happened to be the easiest subject, and that's the reason I majored in math. Then when we were recruited—I say \"we.\" There were several girls—I was from Randolph-Macon [Woman’s College, Lynchburg, Virginia]—who went to work for NACA at Langley [Research Center, Hampton, Virginia], and again I was put in the best division there. It was called PARD, Pilotless Aircraft Research Division. We had the exciting opportunities to launch vehicles, to test different configurations, and how those configurations would [ultimately design] spacecraft by virtue of the shape of the nose. We went from cones to blunt bodies. You see today your different vehicles are all blunt bodies. So I was right there and enjoyed it. It was fun."

        "utterance": "I imagine that gave me the opportunity, because I don't know where they recruited. Of course, today, NASA recruits all over the country, but back in 1948, which is when I graduated from college, and there were not many gals, we were hired as \"computers.\" Computers didn't exist, you understand. We had calculators. They gave us civil service exams, and I was fortunate enough to pass the exam at a couple of grades higher than I was hired in, so I got raises.\\n\\n But the thing that I would like to tell has something to do with Dr. [Maxime A.] Faget. Working as a computer, [later] we were classified as mathematicians. One day my project was to solve a triple integral for an engineer, so it didn't require using my calculator. I could just do it at my desk. Max's secretary was going to get married, and so I was asked to be his secretary for two weeks while she was on her honeymoon. Well, we shared the same office, and all I did was—I don't know how to type, still. Made my girls take typing before they went off to college. I would answer the phone, distribute the mail, and work my triple integral. I did this for two weeks.\\n\\n We all were friends. [There were] 100 people in this particular division, but we would party and get together frequently, so we knew each other well. This Friday, the end of my two weeks, Max said, \"Dottie, how would you like to work for me all the time?\"\\n\\n I thought he was being funny, because I don't type, and I knew that this was the last day and Shirley was returning Monday. I said, \"Sure,\" in a very flip way.\\n\\n He gets up, goes downstairs to talk to the division chief, and he returns and he says, \"Dottie, you start working for me Monday.\"\\n\\n Well, I looked at him like, \"All right,\" you know. So they found me a desk, and I was put with some engineers who were beautiful and taught me how to be an engineer. I learned on the job.\\n\\n Brilliant men have touched my life throughout my career, and I couldn't help but win and do well because these people did guide me and continued to guide me even when I got here in Texas. But that was when I went to work for Max Faget. It was just a marvelous experience. That also led the path of my becoming a project engineer, which is something rare today, male or female, anywhere. Projects are so large, you can't have just one project manager.\\n\\n But our launching of spacecraft from Wallops Island, which is off the coast of Virginia [in the] Atlantic Ocean, I had to do everything in the design and the trajectory and the stability analysis of the spacecraft, plan the instrumentation, and then when the data returned, analyze those data and document them. If you've seen my bibliography, you see these reports. As our Mach numbers increased, our knowledge increased…and that is how we started the development of today we can go to the moon and go to Mars or wherever. It was just by virtue of that experience at PARD, Langley."

I started out with what we call a single-stage vehicle, and before I left Langley and came to Texas, I had a five-stage vehicle in which the payload, if you would, or the configuration, the nose, was going to be the shape of the blunt body of the Mercury. So I did progress in complexity of the firings or the different flights that we had."

        "utterance": "Yes, it was another five-stage vehicle. We were waiting for another rocket to be launched before we could go. Well, we waited all day long. The wind picks up, and you wanted to make sure that your vehicle[’s trajectory] would not be [jeopardized] by the wind. You wanted to orient it properly…\\n\\n We'd sent up balloons to see which way the wind [was] blowing, get…atmospheric data, and finally [by] dark [we were] able to launch. It was exciting, a night launch, because you'd see, as each stage separated, of course, after a while they're too far from you, but you could see the fire, if you will, from their rockets. But the fifth stage we never saw ignite. [We would have to] wait to get the data telemetered back to us [to] see what we could do.\\n\\n Out from Wallops Island you took a ferry to the mainland, where a car was parked, then drive home. It's midnight. We were on this ferry. We're going through these charts, trying to determine [why] that fifth stage did not ignite. Now, this is what we would call a failure. Turned out that it did give us data, indeed, but the rush and the thrill of trying to solve a problem was the fun part of our job. I don't think it [will] go down in history as anything except you learn with each experience, of course, and that's what I did every day of my life.\\n\\n In the old days, in the beginning—I did start a talk one time, I was invited to speak to some seniors, high school seniors at the University of Texas in Arlington, and I think it was to lure them to go to that school, and I began my talk with, \"In the beginning.\" So I frequently say that and I laugh each time. But I've already forgotten what I wanted to tell you."

It was that exciting.\\n\\n I was married and ultimately had two daughters, fortunate enough to have full-time help, because that was how I could work…to make sure I had someone at my house at all times.

I presumed that he mentioned Gilruth in his talk. Gilruth had been my division chief at one time.\\n\\n I'd like to tell a story about Bob Gilruth, if I may, this beautiful, brilliant man who now has Alzheimer's. Walked upstairs, and I worked in an office with perhaps seven men, and I'm in my little corner. He stops at the door, and I can see him. The men are discussing something, trying to solve a problem, and he listens. Then he asks a question which turned their thinking around and headed them down the right path. And he turned around, with a smile on his face, and walked out. I thought, there goes a big man. He didn't tell them how to do it; he just asked a question. Well, that became my modus operandi when I became a manager over men. I knew never tell anyone how to do his job, but I would ask questions.\\n\\n We formed a team—and I'm getting way ahead of myself—this is how when I become a project subsystem manager for aerothermodynamics on the Shuttle. At the contractor there were fifty-six men who had to respond to me because I [was responsible for the] heating to the vehicle both during ascent and during entry. It would require that number of people. Well, we have remained friends even to this day, quite a few of the men. We still correspond or they'll come in town, give me a call, because we worked as a team and I, in my endeavor to do my job, would have each man come to me, inform me how he was progressing, and I would just ask questions, knowing sometimes the answers. And I think it's because of Bob Gilruth, this brilliant, beautiful man. And I thought, why can't everyone be like this man?"

You have operations directors and what have you. As I said, we were all friends…\\n\\n And here I had a breakfast, a brunch one Sunday.

And I'll have another story to tell you. When Max designed Mercury, he would make paper models of the capsule as you now see it, and he would put little tabs out, we called trim tabs, to make [the models] stable. I remember him getting up on his desk and he would drop them to see if they were stable. That was in 1958…\\n\\n Well, when Shuttle began, Bob Gilruth had asked Max to design a vehicle, and Max did this in his garage, unknown to anyone. There was a house that separated our houses. Well, the day that a group of us were called in and we were called in secretly, we couldn't tell anybody where we were or anything, Max has a garment bag, and he takes out a model. The first model of the Shuttle was a straight wing. Again he gets up on the desk and he declares it [is] stable in two attitudes, zero degrees angle of attack, so he flies it across the room and someone retrieves it. And [at] 60 degrees angle of attack, and he angles it up by eye and throws it again. And I thought, what goes around comes around. I can remember him standing up with that Mercury, and now here we are again on the Shuttle. [Laughter]\\n\\n But these men who had ideas just were able to bring them to fruition because of this Sputnik, and now we were challenged and we would get funding to do these different ideas. I remember asking Max—every Saturday night for years several couples got together and took dancing lessons. This is in Virginia. We would return to either our house or the Johnsons'. I don't know if you've interviewed Caldwell [C.] Johnson or not, but he and Kitty were one of the couples. We had a breezeway where we danced, and Max had sat down on the sofa and I sat on the arm, and I said, \"Max, now that we're flying Mercury, what are we going to do [next]?\" And he looked up at me and he said, \"Dottie, I'm always thinking.\" [Laughter] And indeed he's thinking even today."

I wasn't looking forward to moving to Houston, where it's hot, even though knowing that it's going to be a new adventure, which I enjoy, so I did have mixed emotions about it.\\n\\n But again another story. They flew a group of us down to find a place to live, and my husband and I are in the motel and I'm thinking, I wonder if there's a way I can talk John into not [moving]—because he had already joined the Space Task Group. I was queen bee at Langley. I had my projects and was happy as a lark. There's a knock on the door, and it's Max. He says, \"I have found where we've going to live. Come on.\"\\n\\n So the three of us get in the car and drive to a community south of here called Dickinson. Indeed, he had found two lots on the bayou. He said, \"Now, Johnny, I have to go back to Virginia tomorrow. I want you to negotiate for my lot, and if you can't get it, then you negotiate for me for this lot. Otherwise, that'll be yours.\" [Laughter] So Max gets on the plane and goes back.\\n\\n Johnny and I go back to Dickinson the next day, and I wish I—I need to ask him, \"What did you do to get Max's lot?\" Because we did. He successfully got the lot for Max. And our lot…had a sign, so we pull up the sign and go to the agent, who also had [a] savings and loan. As we walked in—and this man's office is glassed in, so he can see [us], and he has someone in there whom he dismisses very quickly, because…he says, \"I've had a lot of people ask me about property, but I've never had them bring me the sign before.\" [Laughter]\\n\\n The three of us went to lunch, and we became very good friends with this man and bought that lot. From then on, it was fun. I designed our house. In fact, yes, I returned to Virginia, and every day at noon, on a piece of graph paper I would do the floor plan. Ultimately that graph paper was given to our architect, who built the house from that, because they put it on blueprints and did it professionally… I don't know if I still have that piece of paper."

The vehicle had gone to angle of attack and had rolled, which we didn't want, and when you have instrumentation which consisted of thermocouples…thermocouples will measure the temperature of the outer skin, and from that temperature we translate that into heating rates, and that's how you design spacecraft, [in] very [simple terms]… Well, with the instrumentation on a certain line and the vehicle is rolled at angle of attack, it kind of challenges the interpretation of those data. That was a very difficult paper, I remember. It took quite a while to [analyze the data]. But again, it was a challenge and fun."

        "utterance": "Oh, yes. [Laughter] Interestingly enough, I would have to make the figures. That means taking these data points and fairing a curve, and then putting them on charts. Sometimes the charts had the values of the parameters that you were plotting. I would type the numbers, spaced an inch apart, and sometimes it worked. I don't know how. You did everything. In fact, that's the beauty of how we all started out. We had hands-on engineering. Every engineer faired data and they could feel it and understand it and [understand] the meaning. Today, projects are large, you have contractors who do all the work, and so the engineers are just monitoring the contract.\\n\\n Now, I say that and it sounds derogatory, the way I said that, but it doesn't give them the opportunity to really get the feel of it. But a project that—and I'm really skipping ahead—just before I retired, I was the local manager for a project called AFE, Aerobrake Flight Experiment. We initiated it with the idea it would give the engineers hands-on opportunity, hands-on engineering opportunity. We had twenty-six people here at JSC to design the brake part, if you will, the blunt entry face. It was a four-center project, again with the idea that it would be hands-on engineering. The propulsion system which was behind this brake was to be done by Marshall [Space Flight Center] in Huntsville, Alabama, and then we had primary investigators from Ames [Research Center, Mountain View, California] and Langley.\\n\\n Well, in the course of this hands-on engineering, we here at JSC designed and manufactured that brake. I'm proud to say that. [Unfortunately,] the paperwork associated with this project, which another center imposed on us, became so costly that it cost more than the hardware, and the project was canceled.\\n\\n This project, to me, was going to help justify the Space Station, which meant you could have a vehicle at the Space Station. Now, this is my idea. This wasn't part of Space Station or the AFE's definition. But if a satellite up in geosynchronous orbit went out, we could launch the vehicle from the Space Station, retrieve that satellite. And I must explain. The Space Station is orbiting at 26,000 feet a second. Those in geosynchronous orbit are going 36,000 feet a second. So you have to slow down to rendezvous with this Space Station. All this is in my head. And I could just see, we could get a satellite, brake in the atmosphere, return to the Space Station, and repair the satellite. [AFE] didn't happen, and I'm so disappointed.\\n\\n When I retired—oh, maybe now is the time to tell you this story. Us gals. The night of the party for me here at JSC, one of the [speakers] said, \"Dottie's retirement is a line item in our budget.\" Well, I did not know what he meant or why he said that till I found out later I was replaced by ten men."

        "utterance": "Oh, you're talking about a calorimeter. I remember this. It has another story that is a parallel that has nothing to do with it. We were in apartments. When we moved here, our offices were at Gulfgate, in apartments. I'd been given the project to design a calorimeter to put in the last Mercury that was going to be launched, to make measurements in this ablative body. [Brief interruption]\\n\\n ...calorimeter. And I wonder if that's a story I want to tell. I think it is. And it was on the last Mercury to be launched. We wanted some measurements, because this was an ablative heat shield, and you [could not] get good measurements in ablative [material]. So this calorimeter was to recede, if you will, [with] the ablator. Well, we were in apartments, as I said, and I think my office was in the living room. [Laughter] And a man came in with telephone equipment, and he started doing something with my phone, but I'm working, I'm doing my thing, and finally he said, \"Now, you will be able to answer so many phones.\" And I look[ed] at him like, \"You have lost your mind.\" \"No, I'm not anticipating having to do that.\" He thought I was the secretary. He quickly found out that [I was not]. I was too busy to be diplomatic. I said, \"No, you're not going to do that,\" and up I get and go [to] find the secretary, and she gets things straight. Well, he still wondered what happened. [Laughter] It was ugly…\n\nThis instrument, whatever we did with Mercury, we then attempted to do it on Apollo, and it was a disaster. The Apollo design had what we call wafers, graphite wafers. Of course, Apollo was going to be much higher temperature in [more] recession because it would be simulating coming—in fact, we did put sensors in a flight vehicle to get measurements at this high velocity, because coming back from the moon, you enter at 36,000 feet a second. We'd get temperatures, but the moment that it would be getting interesting for our analysis, the wafer would be gone. So we didn't get any meaningful data [from] the one on Apollo, I'm sorry to say. All we could do is gauge how the material charred, and with our theoretical predictions try to rationalize our predictions with the char depth and slope of the curve, that type of thing.\\n\\n But…instrumentation…[has] just not [been] able to achieve the degree of technology advancement that the spacecraft have. We need sensors that are capable of handling higher temperatures than they are presently designed for. It hasn't kept up with us, if you will, and it's been a challenge, one that we haven't quite achieved. Thinking of the lee side of the vehicle away from the blunt face on the Shuttle, the pressure measurements just were so low that we couldn't get them to the [level of accuracy] that we wanted. Hopefully some day it'll all come together and we'll have the instruments. The materials now are advancing rapidly, that they can withstand high heating, and we'll get [the instrumentation], or they'll get it. I won't be—I hope I'm not designing any sensors anytime soon."

        "utterance": "It's called enthusiasm. One year at Langley, true, they were simple vehicles, one-stage, maybe two-stage vehicles, and in my eight hours, I did ten hours of work in eight hours. I actually launched three vehicles, analyzed the data, and wrote them up in one year. That's moving out. That's really going fast, and doing it with a calculator. Now, this calculator, Friedan, very noisy contraption the size of a small television…[is used to calculate] the trajectory, oh, goodness! You can't begin to appreciate what it takes to calculate the trajectory of a vehicle, and you do it [for] every second…[of time in flight]. Whereas today you just punch a number in and there's the answer. No, you punched lots of numbers. To do that and three of them in one year was quite an achievement.\\n\\n I'm so glad I can talk with just us gals, because in this man's world, I knew that I had to take ten giant steps. This is going to go into the answer of your question of how did the men accept it. The men respected me. They loved me. But I think that those my age had great difficulty letting me be an equal, particularly since I was a math major and not an engineer. Today that isn't true. The young people…give women a little more credit, not that our men didn't. \"Our men,\" men my age. Women still were the wives and the homemakers.\\n\\n The thing that I [find] today—this is a criticism—I went to JSC to a meeting and there was a gal chairing the meeting. When I left, and I was with one of the men—I worked for a contractor at this point—I said, \"You know, that gal was tough.\" And what she had left at home was charm. Both men and women, to deal with other people, you still have to have charm. Now, that might sound old-fashioned to these young gals, but it'll work every time. My family said, \"Dottie, sugar will get you farther than vinegar any day.\" [Laughter] And that stuck.\\n\\n The first interview I had at Langley, hadn't been there long, a woman—and why I was selected, I do not know to this day—came, and as she walked in, she said, \"Do you believe,\" and I wish I had reread this, \"that women working with men have to think like a man, work like a dog, and act like a lady?\" And there was a fourth thing I don't remember. And I said, \"Yes, I agree with that.\" Well, the article came out in the Sunday paper, and in quotes, \"Dottie Lee says,\" and she repeats that. I thought, \"I didn't say that. She said that.\" [Laughter] But that is true. That is true, but yet as the tortoise and the hare eventually. And I did some work that was recognized. I've received many awards.\\n\\n One of the greatest compliments I received, which would answer—you have a question down there, what was my biggest contribution to the heat shield. I have a contribution to the heat shield, but it was my work. Just before we launched Shuttle for the first time, a group of us went to Ames to present to a committee called ASAP Committee. That's the Aeronautical Space Advisory Panel, composed of directors of centers or leaders of industry, a very august group of men. And each of us was to present the status of our discipline in regard to preparation of the launch of Shuttle.\\n\\n I was to be last on the program, and I was the only woman. I had forty-five minutes. I was given that allotted time. Well, I started putting charts together to tell this group of people, who did not necessarily know all the nuances of heat transfer, and I ended up with forty-five charts. Well, you don't give a chart a minute, but I had to tell this story. I looked at my watch and I started talking and turning my viewgraphs and talked. They all listened attentively. And when I finished that last chart, I looked at my watch and I had done it in forty-five minutes. I said, \"Fantastic.\"\\n\\n Well, I'm putting them together and people are milling around because they're going to have to catch planes and what have you, and after a while one of the men from the panel came over, the committee, and said, \"Based on what you have told us today, we're going to recommend to the President that we launch the Shuttle.\" I hope I gave an appropriate response, because I still get chills thinking of that. I really—I was quite proud of that.\\n\\n The other contribution—you know, I've really gone far astray from your question."

I've seen very few women. I've really not had many women I've had to interface with in the private sector.\\n\\n Another story. When I retired, about a month after I retired, I got a call because I was going to travel for a year with my mother, and I got a call from a man at JSC saying, \"Dottie, there's a company up in Detroit that would like some aeroheating support. Could you do that?\" And I said, \"Yes, I'd be glad to do it.\" I had to make my reservations and get my car and everything. I'd been spoiled, because at JSC there were gals that did that for me, and I really appreciated it.\\n\\n Well, as soon as I got back, the president of Eagle Engineering—and I don't know, surely you've met Owen [G.] Morris and company—called me. Bass Redd is the one who called me. He said, \"Dottie, I thought you were going to play for a year. I hear you worked. Come talk to me.\" Well, after having made my own reservations on my own, I said, \"I'll be right there.\" [Laughter] And so [I] went to work for Eagle. I would say three months later, Eagle got a contract with a company in Italy and sent nine of us to Italy to help them design an entry spacecraft. They had put up satellites, but they had never retrieved [one], so they didn't know how to do entry heating per se.\\n\\n I had a reason for telling this. Oh. In this company, and it was called Air Italia—I get that [and the] airline confused. It's now changed its name. It was sponsored by the Italian government, even though it was a private industry. But in this company there was only one woman engineer. She was charming. They could all speak English except one young man. Of the nine of us, we each had a separate discipline, mine, of course, being heating. We had a thermal protection man and a retrieval man and an aeronautics, various disciplines. One of the young men in my group couldn't speak English, but he sat and he watched me the whole time. We were there for nine days. [Laughter] I thought, I wonder if he's trying to learn English, and with this Southern accent? I thought no telling what—but that was fascinating. There was only one woman in that company."

We picked up girls along the route all the way up to Lynchburg, Virginia. As the train pulled out, I looked out and Mother is just heart-broken, tears. Oh, she was heart-broken. Her only child. But prior to that time, they had sent me to camp in North Carolina for eight weeks each year, to get me out of the heat of New Orleans, at Lake Lure Camp for Girls, which was a personality development camp and a marvelous opportunity for me. I think it had a large influence on my personality.\\n\\n Before I went to Lake Lure, I can remember being so bashful that if you asked me a question, I would answer it, but that was the extent of my conversation in the classroom. When I came back, I was nominated and selected to be a class officer and various things. So that was a tremendous opportunity for me.\\n\\n [After I graduated from college] when I returned to New Orleans and a month later took the job at Langley, Mother was not going to have her daughter again, and I think I may have caught the same train. I don't remember how I got to Newport News. Doesn't matter. Really, Hampton, Virginia. I left Mother.\\n\\n Then I married, and when the first child was coming, Mother told my stepfather, \"We are moving to Virginia.\" And then when I moved down here, again, in fact, it was tragic, my stepfather died very suddenly before I moved. Johnny had already moved down, and [the girls and I] were going to follow suit. Well, when Mother retired—Mother, by the way, was a budget analyst for the IRS, so she moved down here, and her last twenty years were spent here. Yes, twenty years. So we did get together, and her last three and a half years, she lived with me. We were close friends."

Things here, particularly when we were put on the schedule for the Apollo, when [John F.] Kennedy said, \"Before this decade is out,\" and we were in a race with Russia, but again you worked because you wanted to.\\n\\n John and I drove in separate cars, fortunately, so he could stay late or I could stay late, and, as I said, I had full-time help until [our] girls were through high school. We did, we worked and volunteered many hours, but then I did that when I worked for Eagle. We were writing a proposal. Of course, you use your own money when a company's writing a proposal. And they asked that we would limit our hours to eight hours a day. Well, of course, you want the company to succeed and you want to get that proposal, so you volunteer. I think when you like your work, it's not work; you just do it. I never saw anyone gripe or complain. You just knew it had to be done.\\n\\n I'm suddenly remembering the first flight of the Shuttle and when they opened up the payload bay doors and you see the tiles [off of] the OMS [Orbital Maneuvering System] pod. I actually cried. I'm sitting in a room with eight or ten men, and there's silence and you're sick at your stomach. Immediately the question is, can they come back? Well, I get on the phone with my counterparts at the contractor, but I have to determine the heating here as they're doing the same in California, and their bosses are here with us.\\n\\n At about eleven o'clock at night that first day…[after only drinking water all day and working steadily], we got on the telecon with the [contractor] bosses sitting with me…and we declared that indeed [the orbiter] can [enter], \"You will not burn up the spacecraft.\" We here had been told, \"Be prepared to return to the office at 4:30 tomorrow morning…,” because at 5:00 we were going to tell headquarters in Washington the findings. Well, fortunately I lived right across the street.\\n\\n I remember getting in the car at midnight, walking into my house, and I had not eaten any food. I opened the refrigerator door, and, like a child, stood there, like, \"What can I eat?\" and there was a patty sausage. I fixed me a Tangaray on the rocks, I ate that sausage, drank my drink, went to my bedroom, took a shower, got in bed, and three hours later got up, got dressed, and was back out here, or at JSC, at the appointed time, to say, \"Yes, they can come back.\" You were tired, but you had to do that. And nobody complained, nobody griped. It was something you had to do."

The head of that section was Bob Ried, that I mentioned earlier, felt that I could be…the person to work with the contractor, to see that whatever our requirements were, the contractor met. The contractor was responsible for the design. In my particular area I had to see that they did it correctly, if you will. I guess Bob felt that I was capable, and it was he who appointed me to be the subsystem manager.\\n\\n Meanwhile, there was another man. I don't know if you have met with Milt [Milton A.] Silveira. He was the deputy to Aaron Cohen, who was in charge of the Orbiter part of the Shuttle system. Milt had been assigned to be over the subsystem managers, and he approved that appointment and felt that I was capable of being the contract monitor, if you will, for the aeroheating. I just was there, again, at the right place at the right time. The men responded to me well.\\n\\n Previous to that, I had a small group of contractors support me on the Apollo Project, so that gave me [managerial] experience. I did something that I recommended to my daughters, because they both work with men, one with chemists and the other with lawyers. I said, \"Write down everything you want done, just one-liners, so that there's no misunderstanding in your communication when you ask someone or tell someone what you want done.\" Because I've left meetings with ten people and they heard ten different things come out of the mouth of the man asking for the support. I said, \"Write [it] down, and you'll have a copy, the contractor will have a copy,\" and…I just knew [what] to do… There was no textbook that told me how to.

        "utterance": "Well, it was different. Frankly, when we finished Apollo, which was a marvelous experience, we had several facets to the heating world, such as radiative heating. [When] you have a [strong] shock in front of the vehicle, coming back at 36,000 feet a second, you didn't know…[all of the] contributors to the heating. You have convective and you have radiative heating. Behind that shock you have a high spike of radiative heating, and then it will reach equilibrium and get less intense as [the flow] approaches…the spacecraft.\\n\\n Well, that was quite a challenge, trying to determine how high that heating would be. When we started Shuttle, many of us were asked to determine how complex is the Shuttle going to be relative to Apollo. Well, to the aeroheating person, as well as the aerodynamicist, I put a factor of 10 more complex, because you have the Orbiter, which is the airplane-like structure, external tank that houses the liquid hydrogen and oxygen, the [two] solid rocket boosters, plus we had nozzles at the back end of the Orbiter. Those are the four elements…of the Shuttle system.\\n\\n Well, the [air] flow around [and between] each of those elements…[is complex]. As a designer of a spacecraft, you want your flow to remain laminar as long as possible, because once you get turbulent flow, that increases the heating significantly. …To describe that environment analytically or theoretically is very complex. So the Shuttle was much more significant in its challenge than the Apollo…\\n\\n And what was your question? How did it get different? What did you ask me? [Laughter]"

We had tiles, if you'll remember…on the Orbiter. Trying to instrument the SRB [Solid Rocket Boosters] and the ET [External Tank] was a challenge [because] you [couldn’t] penetrate the skin. So that you would not jeopardize the safety.\\n\\n And the fact that the man was in there…did interfere once with [a couple] of the flights… The aerodynamicists wanted to get various effects of angle of attack on the aerodynamics of the vehicle, and so came up with the idea [of] what we call pushover-pullup. Well, I didn't like that, because that was going to disturb this nice flow that we had so carefully [maintained with] smooth [tiles] so it would not prematurely trip the boundary layer from laminar to turbulent.\\n\\n Well, [Joe H.] Engle, who was one of the astronauts, had me go over to the trainer and get into the simulator with him, and believe it or not, he said, \"Now, Dottie, we're going to go five seconds down,\" and he did, \"1001, 1002, 1003,\" and then four, five, and then up. I said, \"Well, that's all very good, but you could still trip the boundary layer.\" He wanted to show that he wasn't going to do anything to my vehicle. Well, I was outnumbered. And indeed, it must have been…STS-4…when they did [the pushover-pullup and] it tripped the boundary layer. Fortunately, [the flow] re-lamarized, [i.e.] went back to laminar, but…we had that trouble for those few seconds. It wasn't enough to cause so much heating that we exceeded the capability of the thermal protection system, but we did upset the [flow] and…I knew we were going to do that. But the man was safe. The only time we worried was that first vehicle, when we lost the OMS pod covering, I mean the tiles on the front."

It's a terrible burden we put on the people, but we did not want to have a rough surface, because that can cause tripping of the boundary layer. Oh, I memorized practically all 35,000 tiles, and would crawl up on scaffolding and look at things once they were up and in the VAB [Vehicle Assembly Building]. I don't know if you've seen all this.

But as the design was developing, I went to the drawing board to see how they were progressing, and [the] designer that day had put a sharp corner [on the OV]. Well, we couldn't take that. Now, the aerodynamicists might want it for better lift, but aeroheating people didn't want that. So I got with my counterpart and I said, \"They're going to have to change this design.\" Fortunately, the man in charge [of the design] recognized that if I said so, [his response was,] \"Yes, ma'am.\" We called a meeting, and in forty-five minutes that design was changed so that it would be a smooth configuration.\\n\\n Soon after that, I was here at JSC and I think Hans [M.] Mark, who was the director of Ames at the time—and, by the way, he's [one] I'm sure you've talked with—and Glen Goodwin, and they had with [them] Dr. Teller, Edward Teller. I think he was a nuclear physicist. I speak in the past, because I think he recently died. Brilliant man. Why he was there, I don't know. Well, I'm trying to describe this gradual radius of curvature change as you look at the side of the nose [so] that it maintains its smoothness. And Dr. Teller said, \"You mean like a French curve.\" And I said, \"Yes! Like a French curve! I could kiss you for saying that.\" [Laughter] I didn't. And I completed my presentation. As I started out, Dr. Teller rose from his chair and bowed. …I thought, how charming. Again, charm still exists in this world.

Well, they had carbon-carbon from the nose to aft of the nose landing gear door.\\n\\n That's very expensive and very heavy, and to make this carbon-carbon leading edge, it's laid up in layers, literally. In fact, I met a man in Dallas who was in one section of the wing, a little old man. Oh, he was so proud of what he was doing. He laid up a layer and he had to get inside. He explained exactly what he did. Can you imagine having the entire bottom of that vehicle past the nose landing gear door out of carbon-carbon?\\n\\n Well, I knew, based on wind tunnel data, that the heating drops off rapidly from the nose as you progress aft, and negotiated with my counterparts at the contractor to [move] that carbon-carbon [forward]. That took all day, because you don't [just tell them to change a design.] They're the designers. They just have to meet our specification. So you have to be diplomatic and you have to negotiate. Indeed, I convinced them that, \"Here's what the theory says,\" …And they agreed, at the end of the day, to take that carbon-carbon off and move it forward as it stands today.\\n\\n Of course, it turned out to be a headache. The tiles immediately behind that carbon-carbon nose, in trying to apply them on this curvature and not have any steps required a lot of retiling. They would have to take it off and put it on, take it off, and so I bet they hated me for doing that. [Laughter] And that saved us, in those days, 7.3 million dollars, so that was a savings.

I don't care how insignificant a fact is. If it's something I didn't know, I'm thrilled to death. The day was not a failure; I learned something, regardless of what it is."

        "utterance": "Oh, yes. Everyone was learning as we progressed. I just remembered something. Again, I was talking with Max Faget in his office here, and he said, \"Dottie, how do you know such and such?\" It had to do with boundary layer transition. And I said, \"Well, Max, it's a judgment call.\" And he said, \"Yes, that's a good word.\" Judgment, which has to come from experience. There are no theories that can predict boundary layer transition. It's been a nemesis to all aerothermodynamicists. I used those words when I was a chair at a session at Langley.\\n\\n So just by experience and looking at data, you have to use judgment sometimes. Today, not everyone has the opportunity to look at data, because there are other people doing it for them. I don't mean to talk against contractors. I'm now a contractor. And you need the help. The engineer at NASA, regardless of the center, needs support, because projects are so large, and you have to have computer and whatever support.\\n\\n Speaking of computers, I told you about the Friedan calculator, the noisy—well, when computers came into being at Langley, to first use a computer in those days, you had cards that you fed into the system. And to get those cards to feed into the system, you had to punch the data. We had a floor between the second and third floor that looked like you were out in the beams of the building, and that's where the keypunch was. Again, I didn't know how to type, but I could do two fingers and a thumb, which I did. I hated that aspect of my job, punching those cards. Then you take this bundle of cards and you go and submit it to a machine.\\n\\n Because of that experience, only recently have I accepted computers. Meanwhile, having had the opportunity to have people work for me, I let everybody else do the computer. I did not want to do the computer. Of course my [daughters] have them. And I'm going to have to break down and get a computer. I'm the only one I know that doesn't have a computer. [Laughter]\\n\\n When the current job—we sold Eagle [Engineering] and then about two years ago I received a phone call saying, \"We need an aerothermodynamicist. Would you come talk to us?\" Well, I thought, yes, because I want to keep busy. I don't ever want to—I'm going to walk to my grave. I'm just not going to stop. Well, at this company I was hired, and it's part time. I can work eight hours, two hours, whatever. It's a nice way to be retired and work. In order to sign out each day, you have to put it on a computer. I was forced to learn this computer.\\n\\n Now, the first time I looked at that mouse, I wanted to make sure I did it, and they said, \"No, Dottie, one hand, not two hands. One hand.\" And it took about a week for me to learn all the steps of just checking out. I worked eight hours on this project or whatever, and I got pretty good at it. I [can] do it in five minutes. Took a half hour the first time. [Laughter] But I got that down. So I'm still learning, and I'm gradually going to accept computers. They're marvelous contraptions. We could not have gone to the moon if we hadn't have had the computer. Just to calculate the trajectory could not have been done on that Friedman calculator. Too long. Couldn't have done it."

I have an interesting story to tell you about that. McDonnell-Douglas, I've always called it [McDAC]. I'm sorry. Max Faget and Bob Piland are behind me as I'm calculating the trajectory for the Mercury as to how many Gs the pilot will experience. The reason they're standing there is because up in Pennsylvania is a man sitting in a centrifuge, waiting to find out how many Gs, because they're going to test him up to that capability. And that was exciting. And you don't make a mistake, because there's a human. That was fun. That really was fun, that being Mercury.\\n\\n When we got the contractor, McDonnell-Douglas, and a man from McDonnell-Douglas gave me this information, he said, \"Dottie, did you know that the first Mercury was designed by twenty-six men at McDonnell-Douglas?\" …In thirteen months, for thirteen million dollars. Now, that's fascinating to me. Today, what's thirteen million dollars?\\n\\n The secret, I think, is that you didn't have so many people involved, because you had brains, you know, like Max and Bob Piland doing a lot of the technical work, but you also had good engineers there. Systems were simple. You did have a life support system…that really makes a design complex, and you want to have redundancy…[to assure safety]. So putting the man in the vehicle makes it much more complex. But today when everybody and his uncle designs one little part—and I don't know how Caldwell feels about that; he could design the whole thing himself—I'm sure, you get too many people, and communication can really get lost…"

        "utterance": "…I had some contractors supporting me on Apollo analyses [and my Division Chief called me to his office on]… a Friday morning, and said, \"Monday you're to report to Building 32. You don't tell anybody where you're going or what you're going to do. Read this document,\" which had other thoughts and concepts about a vehicle that could go up to orbit and return to land.\\n\\n So I had to call my contractors and say, \"I'm going to be out of pocket for a little while. I cannot say anything of where I am.\" And it turned out that when I would need [their support] to make calculations, I couldn't identify [the project]. [It] was just like \"job number ten,\" and I would get in a taxi and go elsewhere, maybe to my [old] building, so they wouldn't know where I was.\\n\\n But in this room we had a representative of each of the disciplines—a trajectory man, a heating gal, a structures man, a TPS man, different people. Max, meanwhile, is designing—or he now has three men on a drawing board doing changes that we would come up with. A design would pass around the room in a matter of hours. Sometimes the design would change three times in a day because I might bump you and then you, in turn, as we go around. That was exciting.\\n\\n We had a man in charge, called Jim [James A.] Chamberlin. He's now deceased. He and a group of AVRO [A.V. Roe Aircraft, Ltd.] men from Canada had come to us at Langley, brilliant. He never finished a sentence. But we ate lunch together every day, he and another man and I. I got so I knew what he was saying or going to say or didn't say. Frightening. It really was. He was an amazing man… But we were locked up, literally. There was a guard outside the door.\\n\\n One rainy morning—and this building has no windows. It's…a [highbay] next to an office building. In the one-story office building is Caldwell Johnson. He's division chief at that time, at that office. [As] I'm walking from my car to my building, [with an]…umbrella, and lightning…is very close,…the next thing I knew, I switched hands [holding my umbrella] and I'm shaking my [other] hand, and I must have screamed. I told Caldwell this story, and he said, \"Dottie, I almost turned around and looked outside because it was such a tremendous bolt of thunder.\" [This] has nothing to do with space, but I just happened to think of that story, so I'm telling it. [Laughter]\\n\\n So I get inside and I say, \"I was almost struck by—\" and Johnny happened to call me, I guess to see if I'd gotten to work or whatever. I told him. He said, \"You go find out if you—\" You know, your heart can go into fibrillation. I thought, \"I don't want to get—\" \"Get a taxi come to the door.\" I thought, \"I could get killed just to go find out if I survived.\" [Laughter] But that's just a little side story of things in the daily routine of whatever you do.\\n\\n But that's how you design a vehicle. A small group of people and pass it around the room. And we did it. Of course, ultimately we had to go from the straight wing. I'm sure Max told you all that aspect of it and why, to the swept wing that we now have.\\n\\n We landed on the moon for the first time when we were locked up in that room [designing] Shuttle. I can remember saying, before I knew I was going to be in the Shuttle [project], that I was going to really celebrate our landing on the moon. Well, we landed. No, it's when we were coming back. That's when we were going to celebrate, after the return. That day I'm working. I worked past hours, got in my car to drive home. I was living in Dickinson. I don't know where John is, because he's driving [his car]. As I drive down NASA Road 1, cars are parked everywhere. They're in different bars and places. And I wasn't celebrating. I was just going to go home. I had to relieve the babysitter. [Laughter] And I didn't get to celebrate…\\n\\n But we are the beginning of a project, and so we'd finished our [input] with Apollo. We were starting the next [project]. I've always looked at our work as we are creating tomorrow today. That's what makes it fun."

I never had a football team. [Laughter] Consequently, when my girls went to a high school here, every Friday night we went to the football games. [Laughter] But I knew. I was just lucky, very, very fortunate child and person.\\n\\n Part of that fortunate bit, as a child they would put me in a room and bring the clothes. I could say yes or no to whatever they brought in, and I received many clothes from the time I was little. To this day I can't walk into a department store and buy my clothes. I have a friend who owns a shop in Dickinson. She'll buy for me when she goes to market or she has trunk shows, and if I can't make it, she'll say, \"Dottie'll want that.\" …When she sells the shop, I don't know what I'm going to do.

Well, the time would come—I mean, it's a door right there. And I had to go to the bathroom. I take it back. They did have a barracks. One day I thought, you know, can I walk to that barracks? I was too embarrassed—I was twenty-something—to open that door and go to the bathroom with all those men there. So there were little inconveniences.\\n\\n But I went to work when I was twenty-one years old, and grew, and with my daughters helping me mature, I didn't mature till I was maybe thirty-five. [Laughter] But there were some inconveniences, although the men were not ugly. I was very fortunate. Never in my entire career was I ever embarrassed by a man."

        "utterance": "We started my piece of this hardware, not Explorer, but over here in Mercury. What we still have to do is go through the PowerPoint of the history of simulators, if you will, in the near future. You can imagine this method, in each case, the spacecraft was X and then the simulator was about X, that is about at the same complexity. A little more complexity because you had to simulate this vehicle and still be a simulator in the sense you could put in malfunctions and do instructional procedures. In the case of Mercury, the reason I want to show you this is because we build on this initial spacecraft.\\n\\n The astronaut would get in the simulator, and then there was no visual at all. They just covered up the windows and they didn’t care about day, night, didn’t care about anything. You just sat in there, and there was less than 100 switches in the whole vehicle; there were very few things to do in the spacecraft. No computer, so this is where, on the window—and the window is in front of the guy [mannequin] here—they would turn it around, and this is where the hatch was. This was closed, although there was a small, square window. In order to do a deorbit burn, you’d look through the window. You actually tilted this vehicle down so that the nose is pointed down and backwards. You could tell you were going backwards because the Earth went away from you, went up in your window, so that means you’re going backwards.\\n\\n This angle, you’d tilt them to 10, 20, or 30 degrees. There were lines scribed on the window, and that was all you’d pitch to it, and then you’d push the retro button to fire. In Mercury, you could rotate around but you couldn’t translate. There was no way to go forward, back, left, right, up, or down in this thing, except for those three solid retro motors that slowed you down to come back down. That was it. There was still a lot of training.\\n\\n I’ve got to tell you a story. When Riley [D.] McCafferty, my branch chief, when I started, was training Al [Alan B.] Shepard, there were only two guys that were instructors training him. This is at the Cape [Canaveral, Florida], with the simulator down there. They were so proud of their simulator, they could put in smoke like you had a fire. Years and years ago, if a radio or a TV burned out, you could smell it because there’s a thing called a capacitor, and if it shorted out, it would get cooked, so it would make smoke. When it did, it made this unique smell that you would get. In the simulator, they just had a paper capacitor that had no role except it’d sit there held with two alligator clips and they’d throw a voltage on it and cook it. Of course, it smelled like you had fire in the spacecraft.\\n\\n They gave that malf [malfunction] to Al Shepard one day, and of course, he’s buttoned into this simulator with all this equipment around him, and it scared the hell out of him. He thought the simulator was on fire. He says, “Get me out of here!” There’s this Navy guy, so a lot of conversation about that was pretty salty. He got out and proceeded to chew everybody’s butt up and down the whole thing, all the way up to Deke [Donald K.] Slayton and everybody else. He said, “No more smoke, no more fires.”\\n\\n Coming down in countdown, he’s about two weeks away from flight, and McCafferty’s out there running this sim [simulation], and all of a sudden, [Shepard] says, “McCafferty, God damn it, I told you no more smoke in the simulator.” Of course, they hadn’t put any smoke in the simulator. He says, “God damn it, turn it off, guys, get me out of here.” Everybody’s over trying to get Al out of this thing, and they’re already ripping through the simulator and disconnecting all kinds of stuff trying to find out what the hell’s going on. Then they hear Al laughing in the background. It was a gotcha—he had put them on entirely. There was no smoke, there was no fire. He was just paying them back for what they did to him.\\n\\n When we got to Gemini, same kinds of things. This is where, when I got there just before Gemini IX, in this case, the simulator, you sat kind of horizontal. Once you got in, then the visual would come down—this is where you had a visual—over the top. Very simple, it just gave you a TV camera so you could see the Agena target [vehicle]. You didn’t see the Earth, you didn’t see anything else, you just saw this target vehicle out in front of you if you are near it. The simulation wasn’t bad; it just showed target vehicle and it would move closer or farther away, go up or down, left or right. You’d get in and when you did that, you can imagine sitting in there, Gemini III was only three revs [revolutions], 4.5 hours, that was Gus [Virgil I. Grissom] and John [W. Young].\\n\\n This was where the sandwich from Wolfie’s Restaurant, and all this stuff—of course, you know that was bad for them, too, because by the time you got there, that really good bread that Wolfie’s used, it had dried out, so when they pulled the sandwich out, it’s crumbs just everywhere. It was a mess. Al gave it to John, by the way.\\n\\n Another time about their flight on GT-3, I talked with John. His first flight and his job on first time in space, he had to do the first number two in space, that was one of his jobs, and the bag leaked.\\n\\n Do you remember when you first bought margarine, years and years ago? It was white and there was some rules about it and you couldn’t put colors in it, so you had a little color dot and you squeezed it? Then you would knead the margarine to spread the dye in that pill. That’s what you had to do with your bag of feces after you had filled it. You had germicidal pills because if you didn’t use it, the gas from the feces, the same gas that would get loose in your body, it would blow up and break the bag. You have to take this newly-exited material, break this germicidal pill, and then you have to knead the bag to spread this stuff all around. This is one of the good old days that you think about. That all happened in here, in the spacecraft, but you can imagine Gemini VII, 14 days, two guys, 14 days in here, where they’re not going in further than right there, side by side, that’s all there was. That’s what [James A.] Lovell always says, that he and [Frank] Borman were asshole buddies."

        "utterance": "Probably on his own. Come on over here, one more, before we get around the corner. This is the cockpit for LMS-1 [Lunar Module Simulator], this is the LM Simulator that was here in Houston. In this case, there was only a piece of it. There was more back here where we are standing, and we can talk about this, but you could imagine—come up close so you can see, here—you’re standing here, there’s enough room for about two phone booths, but actually, it’s bigger than phone booths because it side balloons out. It was a pretty good spacious area. This is the hatch, looking from the inside, down here by the crew’s knees.\\n\\n When you were standing here, the guy would have this hand controller for translation, and this one for rotation. It’s right now down; that’s so you could put it out of the way, but you’d pull it up to use it, so you had an armrest. You did that as you were flying. See, there’s an armrest on each one because remember, you’re standing, so you have something to control what’s going on. This telescope is for navigation, this is where you’d look to the stars and align your platform, all this stuff that you had to do. We did that really well on the Moon.\\n\\n What I wanted to get to, though, there was a question about who should go out first, remember, Neil [A. Armstrong] versus Buzz [Aldrin]? The hatch originally opened the other way, and they switched it around. Somebody realized that was a problem, so that the hinge is over there and the latch is over here. In the middle is a [valve] to let the pressure out. That’s where you’d de-press. When you got your suits all ready to go, then you’d crack that valve and let all the air out. Remember, Neil’s here, so you open the door, pull it open as far as you can against Buzz, and then Neil would turn around, so he’s facing backward, kneel down, and then go backwards, crawl backwards out on to the porch and then down the ladder. Then, Buzz would close the door after he took his pictures and did all the planned procedures.\\n\\n It was about 30 minutes later or something, he came out, 25 minutes. He would close the hatch, move around to the left side, open the door up again, turn around, and go out on the porch and down the ladder. It was easier for him to get down because Neil was down below. Neil would say, “Okay, your foot, move a little bit,” you know when you’re feeling around for a ladder, and now, you couldn’t turn around, so it was even worse.\\n\\n The other thing I would like to talk about here is the contact light. There’s a master alarm on each side, and then on the right side is a little square light, and higher up, there’s a little contact light. It created a greenish-blue light at contact.\\n\\n Remember I told you about those probes that hung down from the legs? I was going to get some pictures so you could see those, but you’ll see them sticking out under these landing pads. Through all the years, nobody’s even talked about that. If you look at the photos on the Moon, you can see them sticking out from under the landing pads. You can see they’re bent all different, and you can see what direction we were drifting as they landed. As they landed, and they were drifting left, all the little probes are sticking out on the right side, all the same angle. That was important to us because we could see which way they were going when they touched down. You can’t see it from these pictures, but I will find some better ones to show you.\\n\\n During the landing, you can hear Buzz, he’ll say, “Contact,” and then there was a button there called “Engine Stop,” and you just punch it and you just plop down, shut off the engine."

        "utterance": "The square feet, you could see, it’s about 3 feet by 6. It’s really quite good size. Once you put those suits on, it was pretty full in there, but you gained a lot of space because you had this curvature out, and that’s what gave them some space.\\n\\n [Looking at the Command Module] We flew until 1975. This is the hatch, and this one, we talked about, that the hatch, poor old Gus damn near was killed by his first hatch, when it blew loose, and then this one was coming two spacecraft later. He was on spacecraft 12 and 14, that was the two Block I spacecraft and then Block II, 101 was the one that came along, and it had this new hatch design. You could do activate this lever three times, and they had a nitrogen cartridge here, it would undo all these latches, or dogs, and then it would just pop loose, in which case Ed [Edward H.] White was in the middle, and he was really muscular. If he had that hatch, he’d have got it open. Somebody would have gotten out of there, even during the fire, they would have had some injuries but would have been alive.\\n\\n Think about this as a simulator again, step in close so you can see that this is how the simulator was constructed. This spacecraft is tilted more; it would have been leveled off. You slide in here, then you could stand in the lower equipment bay and look through the sextant and telescope, which is way the hell up here, just out of sight. You see the panel, and then you have the sextant and telescopes stick in through there. You’d be laying in the simulator and you’d sit here like this, but we had real seats like these, so then you could fold them down and get them out of the way and do whatever procedure was needed.\\n\\n On the longer flights, you took out the center couch entirely, folded up to a small thing and just stuck it in the corner. Over on this side, on the wall down here is where the toilet was, the thing that you actually had a little seat and a can below it, and then a hose that led to the wall where there is a vacuum valve. That didn’t get used by anybody. Nobody was going to put their equipment down this thing and then open it to space. We’d go through all this. You can see when you’re here, there’s two windows, one in the commander and one over here in the other pilot, that’s looking forward. That’s looking at the LM, at the docking target up here. Then, two other windows on the side. They were 180 degrees apart on each direction.\\n\\n Those four windows, and then there’s a small circular window, here in the hatch. I said “small,” it’s about 8 inches. That was the view you had during launch. When you launched, though, we had a cork shield over the entire spacecraft including the windows because if the launch escape tower fired, you had to protect all these windows and everything in case you wanted to be able to see later. When you jettisoned the launch escape tower, then we blew the cork cover away. Then you could see out the windows.\\n\\n When you did this mission, though, this is where you’d come home, smack down, this is the same orientation with the parachutes extended. The parachutes, these are called drogue chutes, these are explosively deployed. You could be tumbling or anything. These two would come out and they would drag out the main chutes, which were here, there’s three bays here. See, there’s one, two, three all around, so these big things are packed in here.\\n\\n When you’re coming down, there’s a pilot chute that came out and it dragged this piece covering the parachutes away, it’s pulled away completely, and then that exposed the other chutes. These are drogue chutes; when they fire, that was a big boom, but they’d throw this small parachute way out and they’d pop so that even if it was rolling or tumbling, it caught the spacecraft and stopped it from that maneuver. Then, a few seconds later, the big chutes would come out of there as a package, and they would expand and expand bigger, explosively.\\n\\n These are all the [Reaction Control System] jets, so there’s a set of Command Module, and there’s a jet for entry, and another set on the Service Module. There were 16 on the Service Module, and that let you rotate or translate in all directions. It was a marvelously good machine. These things, there’s two systems, an A and a B, so that you had one on each side, which by itself, it lets you yaw. This one, it’s back to Mercury—you could only rotate, you couldn’t translate because now you are on the way into the atmosphere, you didn’t need to worry about translating. This one, then over here would be roll. See, they’re called “scarfed” when they’re built into the [spacecraft], so one is firing at us and one’s firing the other way.\\n\\n If you can imagine, if you took a thing like an engine bell, but on the side like that, then you’d cut off the edge so one part is gone, so it’s only like this. That’s what you get. The gas is still coming out like a rocket engine. This was really simple. That is aluminum with this resin, this organic, like the fiberglass and resin stuffed in it, so it burned away. Literally, that was the way it was; “ablation” is the term. What I mean is when it burned away it would create a boundary layer, and so it retarded how much heat was hitting it and then you gave away a little of the fabric. You started out, this is about 6 inches thick, and when you go home, it’s about 3 inch thick. Unlike the [Space] Shuttle tiles where you didn’t lose anything; those tiles come home all the time. You can see there’s dings on this heatshield, but this, when it was sent out, it would have been much thicker, by about half of what’s there. The rest has been burned away.\\n\\n This is the umbilical from the Service Module to the Command Module, so when you separated them, it fired the four jets facing up. Back there, it’s an automatic system and it would pull itself away. This thing, it would just pop loose like this, just like a gooseneck, would pop back, and then you’d fly away. This is where the sextant telescope stood out, so the telescope was just a finder’s scope with 1X, or one power magnification, and then the sextant was 60-power scope. It was a great piece of optics. We’re going to see here in a minute, this went on the front end of a Command Module. Remember that Command Module docked up here, on top of the LM. We can talk through that in here, but the pieces are going to be on the Skylab.\\n\\n This is nice; I haven’t been since ’94, whenever they opened this place, because we were putting it all together. This is the ASTP [Apollo-Soyuz Test Project] airlock, we’ve been talking about that. We had to have an airlock because the Apollo operated at 5 psi [pounds per square inch] while the Soyuz operated at 15 psi. I brought this along, a lot of different books, but this is one—and you guys can take pictures or you probably have the book already."

You know what a Saturn V looks like, but this is, they took the same stages, the first and second and then the third stage, but the third stage, the smaller one right here is the lab. They talked about, for a long time, whether to do a wet or a dry workshop. What they talked about here is that—probably some better lighting—when this got to orbit, then when it had to change the telescope, is up in here, up under the white micro-meteorite shield during launch. Then, when the second skin, or protective shield, would open up, it would expand itself.\\n\\n Here’s the lab, this is the portion that was covered by the meteorite shield that’s covered in that white thing, so it’s part of it. This clocks 90 degrees off and is the ATM [Apollo Telescope Mount], the solar telescope. This side was always what we call a Sun side, or anti-Sun, when you talk about the airlocks down here. When we lost the double-side over here, we lost the outer skin, then that meant the Sun side had the full heat of the Sun blazing on it. If you put a hand on it, it’s like 200 degrees inside, and the air temperature was about 130 degrees. We’re going to pick it up from there because what we had to do when we were talking about the flight planning and the training going on, we had them ready to go for a whole set of planned procedures that were all changed. I think we should talk about that later, when we’re not here, but back in the office, about how the simulations went.\\n\\n I’ll probably hit into it, but this set of modules were in Building 5, on the south side of Building 5, where the Command Module and Lunar Module Simulators on the north side, where the Shuttle devices were. The workshop was standing upright, so you could crawl up in through and do all these things in and out; the modules were separated just where they are, where there’s about 10 feet between each one and you could do different flights, different training going on at different times. Schedule them out that way, or we’d do one big sim where we’d have people at Control Center, but remember, that’s not a simulator, but a mockup. It doesn’t make any telemetry, but then we’d have the Skylab Simulator running too, to generate whatever telemetry it did."

        "utterance": "Yes, a lot of coordination, and 200 people, three shifts, going around the clock. I want to stop here, you know what this is? [Walking around the back end of the Skylab workshop display] This is a liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, but oxygen is heavier, so oxygen—this is the oxygen tank and this is the hydrogen tank—in this one, now remember, when it’s dry, NASA talked about launching wet, actually firing it up so it was heavy, full of oxygen and hydrogen. We somehow would evacuate that residual and climb into it and live in it. We didn’t do that. It was too difficult to engineer.\\n\\n This area is where the hydrogen would have been on a Saturn V flight. This was turned into a garbage can. What it did is this long tube just kept bags from banging around, but we had 2 foot by 18 inch canvas bags, effectively, put all the garbage into them every day, and then you would put it through an airlock. Remember this is a vacuum here. Send those bags down here, and they were just floating around all the time, until it reentered. This would have been right at the end of this. This is only part of the hydrogen tank; they cut it off half to fit in Building 5 to make the whole sphere of what this thing would have been here, a little further back. We’re just starting at the garbage end of the space station, but just come up a little bit more so everybody can get in.\\n\\n This is an airlock, actually, so you had garbage, anything you’d want to get rid of, you would pop the top of this waste airlock, put this bag that was just form-fitted to go into there, and then you’d close the top, open the bottom to turn it loose, and then that handle would actually shove that bag down out of the airlock, down that long tube, and just like sausages, just pushed them down through there. Then, you’d close the bottom again and it was ready for the next time. That’s everything we did. I got to talk about that in a minute.\\n\\n Let’s go over here. This is where you slept. For the first time, you had somewhere to sleep while in space, so there’s one here, one here, and one here [pointing to the three sleep compartments]. It was interesting, everybody loved them. It was the first time that when you slept, you didn’t have to deal with everybody else’s snoring and whatever else. They had little folded doors that when you closed, you’d get a little privacy. In here, you had personal items. We were dealing with not eight-track but little cassette recorders in those days, so that’s what they used. They had music to listen to, family voices and things like that.\\n\\n Some crews, they liked the music the same way, so they’d have the music floating around in here, they’d have it playing all the time, so a lot of batteries went up with them, AA batteries. When you’d get through that, you can see the black devices on the wall—a towel rack doesn’t work with no gravity, so when you had a towel or washcloth, to dry it out, you’d take the corner of it and stick it in there, and then that’d just float around. Mostly, when we were training, they were hanging like that [towel] does, and we got them out of the way because it was a pain in the ass to deal with them. Each person had a communications unit so you could talk to each other around the lab or to the ground. There’s one in each of the compartments. If somebody could call you during the night, you could be in contact right away.\\n\\n This is a rotating litter chair, you’ve heard of this thing, where they’re trying to figure out space sickness. This chair was used to see how to make them sick. That’s some stories I’ve got about the zero-G airplane [KC-135], but I’ll tell you about that later. Here, they really were very tolerant of this kind of thing, but the way this worked, you would sit in there like a barber chair, and they’d spin it. Then, you would have to do this thing [showing head motions, left and right, forward and backward] to try to elicit nausea. If you got nausea, you’d stop, and that’s what they did all the time. We did this on the Vomit Comet [KC-135 reduced gravity aircraft] all the time, on the ground and then with the crew flying in orbit. You know what this is? Just look at it. It’s a fire extinguisher, just pressurized. You’ll see those around the place, different places."

        "utterance": "Yes, yes. Let me go up here. This one up here is the bathroom. Stay where you are, you might come over here a little bit closer, but you want to see, this is the top, if you think about it, so that’s a light up on top. What you’ve got down here, there’s three silver-looking things. That’s the urine pool, that’s a urine collector, one for each crewman. Males, the plumbing is a lot easier to deal with than it was later, although we worked all that out, but the fact is it was a 2-liter bag, a plastic bag in there, and the way the protocol worked is you would work—remember, I’m the flight planner, we’ve got to deal with all this stuff to get it done—you would get them set up, so they would put a new bag in, in the morning. You would use it all day, and then, when you went to sleep, if you had to get up during the night, you used it, and then when you finished, the first time you used it in the morning, the first one, that created a flight-planning day. Then, you would draw a 100 cc samples out of each one, and then you’d put those bags down this trash chute. Put them into those canvas bags and trash them. Those would sometimes freeze and they’d break. It didn’t matter to us because it’s just out there. When you did it, then they were little plastic cube bags, made special, and they would be stored in the freezers. The freezers are up above your head, over there. I’m going to talk about that in a minute. We called those urine cubecicles.\\n\\n If you had number two, when you go to the bathroom, see where the mirror is? The mirror was really important to you, but the white [seat] is where you sat. There’s two anodized-looking blue, green handles because you’ve got to hold yourself on the seat. There’s a thing between your legs there, and the legs would be in that hole there, and then you would have the condom-like thing that’s on you during that time. Each one does this thing in a bag. The nice thing about this is this had a door. It’s been removed so you can see everything here, but in fact, this is it, right here. I’m just looking at it, this is the door right here, but it would flip around and close. You had a modicum of privacy, which you didn’t have in any of the other [spacecraft]; you were just there.\\n\\n Of course, most people came back constipated—they would do anything to avoid this on those shorter flights. There was low-residue food and all that sort of thing; not a lot of fiber until they got home. That’s the deal. What you would do, though, when you filled up a bag, also if you barfed, we’d catch it in a bag. Then, those six gold-looking things are ovens, so you’d put the new stuff in here—you didn’t have to worry about kneading the thing like earlier—you put it in there and dried it, and then you stored that away, and that was part of the sample material coming home. This whole thing, everything else in there is supplies, plastic bags, vomit bags, feces bags, the little, tiny icicle cubes, urine-cicle cubes that we had.\\n\\n This is food, up here. When we launched it, almost all the food is in here—all the dry food, and utensils. They had these wonderful things. See his feet, see the triangle? See these [grids]? Wherever you were, you could put this through here and twist your foot a little bit, and now you’re going to be able to stay where you are. That was really a nice [feature].\\n\\n See those big tubes coming from up there? Those are bringing that fresh air through the air conditioning. The air conduits came down here, underneath the floor. It’s like a plenum, and then the air would flow up back to the top. We talked about that you’d hate to fly with people that had dandruff or everything else, but that’s the air return filter up there, the six-sided thing. That was vacuumed out about twice a day, to get all the stuff out.\\n\\n Now, let’s come back down here. The food, for the first time, they had trays. See, it’s a white tray, and some of the things, there was a place where you put these little aluminum cans in them, and they would get heated. For the first time, we flew with shrimp and spaghetti and steak, but everything was in a goopy sauce because it wouldn’t come loose. You would cut it, like the steak, but it stayed in there because the goop would try to keep it all together, and then you would just spear them with a fork and pull it out. The food was way better than anything we’d ever flown before.\\n\\n This is a thigh-grabber, see, he’s [the mannequin’s] kind of climbing onto it, but this thing’s hanging out here, you’d get up to it and you’d put your thighs between the two pieces of metal sticking out from the table, and then there’s stirrups at the bottom, so you slide your boots into that, and so you’d be comfortable. It was really quite good.\\n\\n Wonderful window, this is called the wardroom, and you can see there’s a big window, which had a thing you could cover it from outside, but open it up and you could see the Earth going by. There were two decks—this is the lower deck. This is where you slept and go to the bathroom, and then this is all the medical experiments. We have the shower, now the shower, you had 2 quarts of water, 2 quarts of hot water, and what you would do is you’d get in there, it took about an hour, you’d get in and I’ve read some people that say they didn’t do many showers, but as far as I know, they showered all the time. Once a week, I mean, not every day.\\n\\n It’s like Saturday night, we used to joke about it. When they say they do it, they get in like that, it was a beta cloth tent, and with two hoses in there, and soap. You’d spray some water on you and then lather up, and then you would spray a rinse water on you, but then you’d have a vacuum hose that vacuumed it off because there’s no gravity, there’s no drain, it just stayed there. They made a lot of jokes about the face that the water, the surface tension, all the water would be under your left arm or between your legs, things like that. They’d suck it off and get through it, so it was good. They loved the sense of just pure water. Sometimes they would towel themselves off, but then they would, on a daily basis, but on this one, they just used pure water because they found it was tough to get all the soap off. They liked to do their hair, they used the dry soap on this.\\n\\n This is a bicycle ergometer, and they’d have masks on and all of the information was being recorded in these [devices]. This is a lower body negative pressure [experiment], do you guys know about this one? It’s nothing but an empty can, but there was a dam, or tight elastic cloth, around here, this would close around your body. When you go to space, gravity quits happening, and so all of your body migrates up, and so, then you get rid of all your body fluids. You lose about 15-20 percent of your blood because you just urinate it away, the first three days you’re up there.\\n\\n If you put these guys in and then pull a partial negative pressure, so you use the vacuum outside, but very carefully, you’d lower the pressure here, so then the blood would go back down in your lower extremities. That would give you the sense of being lightheaded. It’s a simulation of what’s going to happen when you go home. They did this, everybody did it, and the way it worked, everybody did it, like, once a week. Everybody did the ergometer every day, just for exercise. There’s other things, where every morning, you got up, you weighed yourself—that was another thing—and how do you weigh yourself?\\n\\n Let’s go up here. This is how you did it, right here. What it amounts to is a pendulum, if you have a pendulum and you make it go back and forth, if you’ve ever done that, if you’ve ever controlled a clock like a grandfather clock, if you change the length of the thing, you can change how fast it goes, or you can change the weight, the mass. In this thing, Bill [William E.] Thornton invented this, and it was really good. It’s a pendulum, except when you sit in it, it had four steel blades, so the thing would allow you to move back and forth this way, so you slid forward and back. Your mass would change how long it timed, so there was a little thing that timed you, how long it took to make one cycle. That would translate directly to how much you weighed. They weighed every day, after the first urination, and then that would be the standard for that day, and then everything else going on through the day. These are filters in here, other filters and motors that drove the flow of air going around. It’s nice, I think a very smart thing, to have all this open web work so that the air just flowed along. The air conditioning and everything was up on the exterior around the airlock.\\n\\n That right there, the next module up, is the airlock. You’d go in there, close this hatch, close the one on the other side. The one guy not going out is up in the Command Module end because the Command Module would be docked up in that end, way at the other end, and we’ll talk about that later. This is the workshop, that’s the airlock, and the next part is the solar experiment area. That’s where you ran the space telescope, the solar telescopes and Earth resources, and experiments like that. This thing here, these nitrogen bottles, we brought an early version of the astronaut AMU, the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit. It’s a far cry from the one we actually flew a lot on Shuttle, but we flew it around in here about three times. We had a lot of fun and it worked very well. Remember, this thing was all launched pretty much ready to go, so these tanks are all the water you’re going to have on the whole time, so all the way around, the buff-colored tanks.\\n\\n The white lockers are equipment, cameras, everything like that—film, remember, you don’t have digital at this time, it’s all film. It’s here, it’s underneath this. We had a coffin, almost, it was very thick. It was funny, it was made of very, very heavy aluminum with some kind of thing mixed into it, an alloy, but it was where you put all the film. The thicker part, the part for Skylab 4, was thicker than the one to try to give you more protection, so the Skylab 2 had less protection because you’re going to use it up, and then 3 and then 4. The heat screwed it all up, so we had to bring film up all the time. Some of the film, they were able to test it and they got some out of it, but mostly, it was all destroyed because the 100-and-X degrees in here during the time after you launched.\\n\\n Before you come in here, everybody sees a movie, and part of it. This [mannequin] is supposed to be Paul [J.] Weitz. Remember you saw them, Al [Alan L.] Bean was a diver in the Navy, at the Academy. He was able to jump and turn and spin and do all this stuff, and he stopped, obviously. A lot of them got to learn how to do a little bit; he was really, really good. Some of them just jumped around here. This is off-duty. It’s the kind of thing where so many times, [the film we see is] what they’re doing, eating, whatever, that’s because they didn’t have time to do filming when they’re working. It worked out pretty well.\\n\\n All of this equipment that you see, and then the blue handholds, just literally, we were worried about people getting trapped, getting stuck in the middle. Of course, what did they do? They’re guys, so they tried to trap themselves out in the middle. That is, they tried it. They would put them out with zero movement and then turn them loose, and you could swim out of there. You could not get trapped. If you could do swimming motions, it wasn’t much, but just like air is so much different than water, you could gradually make a motion, forward or backward, and you could drift over and get to a wall. If you’re a mile out from there, probably not going to work, if you drift away from the spacecraft, but in here, this is good.\\n\\n There were nine people who flew up here [on Skylab]. On one of the flights, [one of the astronauts] found the little bedroom compartment confining; it was a little bit too confined to be in that little coffin-like thing to sleep. So, when it’s time to go to bed, the other two had disappeared in their little cubbyholes, and he’d take two lanyards and stick himself between the wall, and he’d sleep here. He’d just curl up, turn out the lights—and turn out the lights meant close the windows, too, because it’s day/night and day/night, it could drive you crazy. It also made a significant change in temperature, even with everything else. It was nice. He found it very, very good.\\n\\n This is the anti-solar airlock. There were two airlocks built into the [module]. This is a great idea, and we had all these experiments that would plug in. You have like a 1 foot by 1 foot [pallet], you put an experiment on here that was a telescope or it was going to look outside, or you slide things outside and expose them and then bring them back in. This is the anti-solar airlock, and this is the solar airlock up here. This is the one where in the 15 days between May 1 and May 15, we re-engineered all these kinds of things. A guy came up with an idea, Jack, it begins with a K?"

        "utterance": "Yes, there you go. He and his guys engineered this parasol. In other words, you had one of those strapped under the Command Module, brought it up here, and they put it in, and then extended with some poles, extended out, and then it popped out, and then you pulled it back in tight and tied it off, and then that was it for that airlock. We lost it because that’s the Sun side. Just as soon as it went out there, the temperature in here started dropping. It was incomplete in the sense that the guys had it cocked off about 15 degrees, so there was still some hotspots, but it worked. Everything that we wanted to do, it worked. It could have all been fixed, but somebody said, “Leave it alone.” It’s one of those things, like, if ain’t broke, don’t fix it because it’s working.\\n\\n The second crew brought up a parasol that covered the whole thing; it’s a Sun shade that had wires and ropes. They went out on an EVA [extravehicular activity] and fixed it. That made this workshop livable. You imagine, the Command Module’s way up there, we’re going to go outside and go around, it was not bad by the time you got in past this hatch. This is the place where they weren’t even sending air down here because it just was so hot, it would overload the air conditioning system as it’s running. They would stand up there, they were shirtless, just a pair of drawers, gym socks, and shoes, and work gloves. They got some burns because if you touched anything, it was really hot.\\n\\n They would come down with the idea of putting that thing together, and they’d stay down here about 60 to 90 seconds, and then they’d have to scoot back up. It was too damn hot, and the other guy would come down. Seems like we had only two of those work gloves, so we had to swap gloves around, and Pete [Charles C. Conrad] was smaller, the other two guys were about the same size. They got it in there, put it up, and immediately, it was good. By the next day, the temperature was down, like, over to 100, and the next day, it stayed at about 80. Until we got the other second cover up, it was not great, but beat the hell out of everything else you had. I’ll stop a minute, you guys have questions in here?"

        "utterance": "I always feel that you guys are at the place where you should understand some of this material, just how we went through, so you can imagine the scheduling nightmare we had because all of the experiments and procedures we were going to do these first few days when they got up there, that’s out the window, and you just start over, and we did. ASP [Activities Scheduling Program], even though it was a terrible thing, it beat the heck out of drawing on paper and doing everything manually.\\n\\n Do you remember on ISS [International Space Station], we have gyros? Here, they had three on here, so this is one of them. We controlled the attitude not by firing engines, but by using the momentum wheels. Remember, this is the airlock, and this is the systems module, if you will, so let’s go the other end and then we’ll try to look back the other way, just to get a little distance.\\n\\n Remember Gemini? Remember this Skylab was built by McDonnell Douglas, that’s a Gemini hatch, so they just took one and plugged it into that. This is where you came out to do EVA, so if you go back and look at the Gemini with the two hatches that open up, they just took one that they had, still, saved the money, and that’s what it is. The two guys would get in there, close that hatch and this hatch, and then the Command Module’s docked down here, so one guy’s back here and he could watch them outside, there. They’d close up and then they’d come out, and they were not on PLSS [Portable Life Support System], like they used on the Moon. Instead, they had an umbilical cord. This is when they went out the first time, Pete did this, and they went out with cutters because remember, one of the solar rays was still jammed down against the side of the workshop, so they went out and cut it, and they went up and the array flung him to the full length of that umbilical. Paul was out there and just pulled him back down. Joe [Joseph P.] Kerwin was inside.\\n\\n All the tanks, again, this is breathing oxygen, all the stuff like that around this one, right in here. That white thing, there’s three of those momentum gyros at different angles, and those are the gyros, CMGs, Controlled Momentum Gyros. If we’re thinking about a rescue, this is the main dock. You would come up and dock the Command Module into this thing [??]. This was a rescue one; we fixed it up so there was another place to dock. What it gives you is a chance, now, I want you to stick your head in here. This is toward the workshop, if you look down there, and this is, I think underneath, this is the solar control, this is all the six telescopes and all these different controls.\\n\\n This is the sunward side, you remember that thing is pointed out that way, and there were six telescopes in there. This was the best thing we’d ever done as far as telescopes looking at the Sun; we just blew everybody’s science away. It was amazing; all these things we thought, you know, when you go up and do a couple of experiments and you start over because everything you thought before is just wrong. I talked about this before, but these are latches for the drogue. I’m going to talk about that in a minute, how you dock, because it was back to Apollo through here. Let me get myself oriented.\\n\\n This is the ATM, this is Apollo telescope right here. This is the EREP, the Earth Resources [Experiment] Package, here. What they would do is they’d lay on this surface, and this, actually, they tracked targets, it was like a telescope. When you flew over, the thing stayed in an orbital rate, we called it. It would rotate around the Earth, so the Earth was down there. This was when you’re doing this experiment, so you got people on the ground, people in the airplanes, and now we’re going over the same target, and they would track it with the little bar and take pictures with all these six different cameras simultaneously, in different frequencies.\\n\\n This became the prototype for [Earth observations], and doing multiple spectrum pictures going on. That was a scheduling nightmare, but you could see that you had to get a place, and that was postulated ahead of time before the launch. Then, you had to put this other guy in the field in Mongolia or wherever they were, somewhere. They were all over the world, I mean, anywhere except China and Russia, at the time. Everybody wanted to, “Come take pictures of my terrain, or rivers, or lakes, I want to see the disease I’ve got, the quality of the thing, or the advance of deserts,” or all of the things that you care about.\\n\\n This is the second docking slot; now, let’s go talk for a minute about docking. This is a different view. This is the hatch that we looked from the other one. Here’s the same three things we’d get in, and then you’d stand down on the lower equipment bay. There’s a hatch right here that kept you safe. You would undo that hatch and you pulled it down out of the way, you physically removed it form there and set it down underneath these things. Let’s talk about docking. This was the way Skylab was, but it’s the LM, too. The top of this thing, this was a probe and drogue, is what they were called, and then below that, there was another hatch on this side.\\n\\n The guys who invented this, I always thought they were marvelous. You had to fly this thing so it would come down—you can see the size, you can see the little latches on there? There’s three of them around there. You flew it such that the probe fell down in and when it went through the hole, these little latches latched it. That’s called “soft dock.” It’s about 2.5 inches across, and so is that hole, about 3 inches of the hole. You’d snap in, and then you would throw a switch, and this thing would suck down in. There’s a little pressurized cartridge in here, and it would pull you back down so that you pulled yourself together, here. See the O-Rings right here? This flat spot here is going to match on with here, and so you’ve got an airtight seal. That’s pulled back, so that’s called “hard dock.”\\n\\n When you got a good thing, you tested, made sure there’s no leaks, then the guys would open up this hatch in here. They would come up in here behind it, and see, there’s a handle here and there’s another handle over there. There’s a couple things. The first thing you do is you undo these little latches, you just pull them back in, so now, this handle would cause those three things to fold up, so they’re out of the way. You could now pull this whole thing back inside. It’d fold itself out, you could see, this, when it folds out, when you pull back, these things got broader, they filled up the whole space. Now, by taking the pressure off this thing, he was able to remove this whole thing, just pull it back.\\n\\n So he’s looking through the hole at the drogue, so they come up inside. You could get the drogue and you’d rotate it. It was just like the top of a jar lid, that was in there. You’d twist it this way and you pulled it out, then you’d pull it back in. Now you’re looking at the hatch, mounted up at the LM, or in this case, Skylab. But now, see, these latches right here, there’s 12 of them all the way around here. They would lift them up and snap them down, and they’d bite into the inside of there. Now, you’re structurally good, so that puts it all together.\\n\\n This one, we just went all the way inside, but on the LM, then you would connect up a wire, so now you would have power going from the Command Module into the Lunar Module, so now you could talk to it, back and forth. The only thing we wanted to do now is later, when you were ready, you’d fire a switch and you’d blow the LM loose from the slot SLA, the Spacecraft [Lunar Module] Adaptor that’s holding into it, then you’d pull it out. We’ll go over in the Saturn V, if you want, and we can talk through that step. You can see what we’re doing here, anyway.\\n\\n Then, when you’re ready to land, two guys would get in the LM, they’d go up, they put the drogue together. There’s two guys now in the tunnel because you have somebody on each side, and so one guy’s snapping the drogue in, the other one’s putting this docking probe together in an un-pressurized way, and then push it in there so it latches into the hole, establish all these connectors. Each side closed the hatch and then when you’re ready, 3-2-1-0 and they throw the switch, and they extend this thing. They just throw it away, which just gave a gentle push and the two vehicles came apart. Then, they were just free-flying until it came back after the mission, and then you went through all this stuff to get the transfer back through the hole. This is where you have a really rigid mechanical thing, and yet, you’re disassembling, you get it out of the way, and you could go back and forth through the tunnel that was opened up."

This is amazing, and sometime, we have to find you a picture of them putting a Rover on the lunar surface. There’s picture I know they took at Grumman, and I even have a video of a long time, it’s a VHS, so I’ll still try and find it. You might, you guys, be able to find something like that. It’s the damndest thing—I remember Charlie [Charles M.] Duke and John [Young] were on [Apollo] 16, and they were up in Bethpage [New York] at Grumman doing these procedures. I was looking at this picture and I thought, “I’ll be damned,” I even know some of the guys that worked on it, but I was, again, more impressed—and I was impressed a lot by these guys—how good they were at what they did. It was just amazing.\\n\\n Look over here. You can see the probe in there, in the hole. Above it is the same thing we used in the RMS [Remote Manipulator System], when you put the RMS and grab things, this target is, there was a COAS, a Crew Optical Alignment Sight, and you would look back down here. If you lined that out, then the probe and the drogue were lined up, just calibrated to do that. COAS is a Crew Optical Alignment Sight. It’s a manual device like a gun sight.\\n\\n Here’s the solar telescope. Remember, it was launched in line, and then once it was there, it was clocked over by 90 degrees, and then it just stayed there. It was never to be moved again; that was its position to be. It had four solar arrays, so that’s what kept the vehicle alive when it launched. Those spread out and did everything, so that’s why there was power with this upper end, here, but no power down below because one solar array is gone and the other one was jammed shut. Did you talk to any of the guys who did EVA on the way back? Al [Alfred M.] Worden, people like that?"

They’d open the hatch, they’d de-press the [spacecraft], open the hatch, and they would crawl down to about in here, and get film out, big things where they took all kind of pressures when they were in orbit around the Moon, and they would haul it back in, put it inside because you were going to lose all this on the way home. Remember the 16 jets, they’re around the [module] and you could see how they work as couples. It’s called a couple, where if you fire, like, I’m looking at you but I want to look at you, then one jet forward to you and one back here would fire and move over here, and then I’d do the opposite ones to stop. If I want to pitch up, you’d have one this way and one back this way. Or, if I just want to move towards you, then the four behind me would fire and I’d go this way. It was just the logic of making all that happen, where you just did the stick at a time."

This is just for radio communications. Here’s the gyros, now, and they’re at 90 degrees but different angles, so you’d still be stable. Some of the telescopes, you had to come out and get the film out, they’re all film. You had to get the film out of here and take it back in. Back there where the guy is, one guy would stay back there and the other one would go out, and they had an extendable pole that would go out that’s called an AstroMast, and it’s an amazing thing. It’s like a coil of wire, but as you turn it on, it’ll extend. It’s like a spiral of aluminum foil. If you can imagine, if you just made a spiral of it and then you take the inside of it and you stretch it out so you can make a long tube, it’s a little bit thicker than aluminum foil, but that’s what it did. The motor would turn on and you’d extend the sucker out, so there were some of them—come over way back here.\\n\\n These were where the six telescopes, and you’d open, so the Sun is that way. They’d come out and they’d reach down and get film packs up here, or on the side, depending on which instrument it was. All six were there all the time; we didn’t change any of this stuff out like Hubble [Space Telescope], we went up and changed whole cameras and everything, but not on this. All the electronics were here, so you could get them either down here or up at this business end. That’s why this one, that’s why there’s a handrail there, that’s the one that you had to come all the way out here. The guy would come up on his umbilical to his fresh canister, and then he’d send out, these were big canisters, and so they’re hard to attach them on this thing. Then, the guy back there would bring the used canister back down, and they took turns, who got to go way up here versus down there, because there was a hell of a view."

Sometimes, they noticed it was colder, the suits were earlier, so it was a little bit colder. They were Apollo suits, basically. In Apollo, you were always in daylight on the Moon, so you didn’t notice that as much. They were good to handle warm; they weren’t so much at heating you up; you had to do the heating, they were good at pumping your heat away."

        "utterance": "Let’s move back this way, all the way. Just talk about this—when we launched it, this was the outer skin. When it went on, the micrometeorite shield was made so it was overlapped like this. It was spring-loaded, so once it got to orbit, they would just release some pins and it would clock out. It rotated out, and I’m trying to do this [demonstrating], but I can’t make my fingers do the right thing. It got bigger, when it did its thing, and that’s a problem.\\n\\n At max Q [maximum dynamic pressure], you know what max Q is? You’ve heard it, but basically, as you go faster and faster and faster, you build up pressure on the vehicle, the atmospheric force on the vehicle gets higher and higher and higher, but the pressure itself, you’re getting less and less atmosphere. There’s a point where you go, the fastest point you go, going through the thickest part of the atmosphere. There’s a curve, and max dynamic pressure means generally about 110,000 feet and about 3,000 feet a second, or something like that.\\n\\n In this case, somebody screwed up in the design and it was kind of open, looking forward, so that pressure got underneath this thing and ripped the second skin away entirely. The skin inside was typical Saturn stuff, one of those big, heavy, iron, but it had a gold coating over it, the idea being it was for temperature change. This piece went away, and what happened is that these things were supposed to pop out like this once they got to orbit.\\n\\n When it started ripping down from here, this is where it went, it just tore everything off. One of these solar arrays was just gone, just three or four wires hanging out, and there’s photos of that. The other one, let’s say it’s this one, it was down, but as the skin ripped down through there, it just jammed this one down. That’s when the guys came out of the airlock here, remember that’s a Gemini airlock, they went over here and Pete crawled down here, and then cut some of the pieces of metal that are holding the array. They had a big bolt-cutter. That’s when this thing suddenly went up, so it was good, that is, now we got much more electro-power to run it. We had beaucoup power, with the two of them, we flew without all that.\\n\\n This is the one where it was just like a gymnast, you know, he was like flung. There’s no way you could type what he said during the time because it was one of those, “Holy shit!” moments. He was good, it was all anchored pretty good, and Paul had the other end of it. He took all the force on his shoulders.\\n\\n Talking about this, the day-to-day things, then it started picking up because this was done, the temperature was under control. The guys took a couple of days to just rest, I mean, it was so enervating to get through to work this heat, but they started to do things and they got going and they got the rhythm going, and they were really good. They started doing the experiments.\\n\\n They all lost weight, when we started out, they lost weight because of the sweating they did, but that came back up. It was really impressive to see how they settled down after about eight days after launch, and they were running just like we’d been there forever, like everything was normal. They got it all together. There were some things periodically, we’d have to stop because it is hotter in here than we thought it would be, we had to change some things. When they did the ergometers, it was a little bit sweatier because they lost heat that way. Overall, the guys were just running really good.\\n\\n When we left, when it was going home, so now they’d undock. This workshop was under control of the MCC [Mission Control Center]. The nice thing about it for me is we’d go back to the office because I had no crew to train, so we’d go back and be working on the plan for the second flight. We had a guy sitting there still who worked a flight plan for the flight controllers because they had to still run it, keeping it alive, so that the guys coming back—you’d have ready for what was the second crew. SL-3 [Skylab 3], but it’s the second crew, and all that stuff, SL-1 being the launch of the vehicle itself. What saved them is the big iron, that this stuff was up here, out of the way. It was not bothered by the accident during launch. When it got up there, the ATM flipped over, and all these things worked, so that Skylab would have been a dead duck if this ATM solar array had not been there. They got this electric power out of this thing running the radios and everything.\\n\\n If you think about it, that was May 1, and we launched on May 15 with a totally new mission. The idea was, yes, we’ll do all that other science we planned to, if we can, but different. They flew them up with three different options of different ways to do—[the parasol], the first one we used, was great, but we had two other planned ideas of how we would approach the flight.\\n\\n [Under the LM display] I took you through the dismount here, but now, think about it—see these guys inside the LM, and the hatch is open, so this would be like when Neil’s down and Buzz is about to come out. You can see, you’d turn around and you’d come outside on the porch, and then you’d come all the way down the ladder.\\n\\n This is the one we joked about, Neil landed pretty softly, Pete Conrad landed even softer than that. Each LM leg had crushable aluminum structures like a shock absorber, but it’s a one time, it would come down and stop, it didn’t rebound. That’s why if you landed semi-hard, it would crush down some of the thing, so the distance between the pad and the bottom of the ladder was smaller, and made it nice to step out. Almost nobody crushed that so far. They landed really well, but that’s why when Neil put it in, it was down a couple of inches, maybe, but that’s when Pete says he came down and he had the whole jump, it’s about 2.5 feet, he had jumped down there. “That might be a small step for Neil, but it’s a big one for Petie!”\\n\\n Around the side, there’s different bays, and so, one like this would have the [Lunar] Rover in it. You pulled it out and you came down, and then the sucker would fold down out of there. If you think about each of these angles, there was a triangular thing going in, inside there, and if you look at a drawing, you can see, in the center part is the engine, going up the middle of it. It’s kind of like a square space, then these things all around in each of the triangular areas. Behind the leg is oxidizer and fuel tanks."

        "utterance": "Well, that’s an interesting path. How did a wayward pilot find his way to the Headquarters building, which is something that a pilot never wants to do? Well, in ’92 I joined NASA as one of the astronauts in the Class of ’92. I was fortunate enough to get to fly on four different shuttle missions. I flew on [Space Shuttle] Columbia STS-75. I flew on [Space Shuttle] Discovery STS-82 to the Hubble, and then flew twice to the station on STS-101 on [Space Shuttle] Atlantis, and STS-105 as the commander on [Space Shuttle] Discovery.\\n\\n Between missions you work other items in the Astronaut Office, other duties as assigned, work a lot of technical issues. One of the things that I had worked on and off over all those years was as an interface between the Astronaut Office and the group at NASA Johnson Space Center [Houston, Texas] that was looking at advance programs going on to Mars. A lot of work was being done by a small group led by Doug [Douglas] Cooke, who is now the ESMD Deputy Associate Administrator.\\n\\n So I got to know Doug Cooke and the group that were doing a lot of these trades, and had always been interested. My background is in aerospace engineering and design of rockets and aircraft, and I was providing a crew perspective in a lot of the design trades they were doing, to figure out how we were going to go to Mars someday.\\n\\n I also ended up working in a new group in the Astronaut Office called the Advanced Programs Office. We started that up about the time we were working on the Orbital Space Plane, OSP. We had a few people from the Astronaut Office, and we were responsible for, again, working on the Astronaut Office, the operator’s perspective, coming up with concept of operation and everything for OSP.\\n\\n In that time also, near the end of OSP, NASA received the vision for space exploration. In 2004 that started, that was kicked off, and myself and a couple of other people were working ideas on the concept of operations. Of course this was after the Columbia accident [STS-107], and we had a few ideas on how to make the next generation of spacecraft safer to do the mission we needed. The concept that we came up with was one that we called Safe, Simple, and Soon. In order to be safer you need a simpler vehicle, and the country probably needed it sooner than later.\\n\\n That was a small group of people including John [M.] Grunsfeld of the Astronaut Office, Marsha [S.] Ivins and myself, and a lot of this was a lot of very deep soul searching after the Columbia accident as to how did we ended up where we are today. The real basic realization is we had built a very, very complex vehicle (the Space Shuttle) that no matter how hard we worked on it, chances of making it or not making it on a mission was on the order of about one in a hundred, and that was as good as it was going to get.\\n\\n So when we were looking at Orbital Space Plane, which was being looked at about the time of the Columbia accident, in fact the requirements, high-level requirements for that came out within three weeks, actually, after the accident, we realized there was a need for somebody to pursue a safe, simple, sooner approach to getting people to and from low-Earth orbit.\\n\\n I’d worked on that and then when the vision for space exploration, came out after that in 2004, started looking at this concept and actually came up with an idea for a vehicle that would meet the performance requirements of going to the Moon, which required more performance, because it’s a healthier mission, and came up with a concept that utilized a solid-rocket booster 1st stage and an upper-stage-LOX-hydrogen engine, which was eventually to become the Ares I launch vehicle.\\n\\n Couldn’t sell that concept inside of NASA, in fact, even submitted information to the JSC Legal Office for a patent on that idea, and they saw no useful application for the idea, and I have that letter today. Pretty much out of frustration I finally decided to leave NASA at the end of 2004 and go off and pursue other opportunities, and ended up through a whole series of events eventually working for ATK Thiokol in Utah. I really went there to go skiing, and they offered me a job, so I said okay.\\n\\n My wife said I had to work, so I got a job, and they were interested in helping me develop the idea of the concept further, which I did. Eventually Mike [Michael D.] Griffin took over NASA. They ran the ESAS [Exploration Systems Architecture Study]. ESAS concluded that the right answer was a vehicle similar to the one I had sketched, with a heavy launch vehicle, which several of us had come to the same conclusion that you needed a heavy launch vehicle.\\n\\n Then I was contacted if I’d be interested in applying for the job as ESMD Associate Administrator, so I applied for the job and was offered the job to come to Headquarters, and basically give up living in a ski resort making a lot of money and working real hours, to come to Washington, D.C., which is the sixty-four-square-mile logic-free zone, to deal with the abuse and work ridiculous hours at half the pay, but happy to do so, because it’s in the pursuit of a worthy goal. So that’s a long answer to a short question, how did I get here."

        "utterance": "That’s a great question. NASA, when I showed up at NASA in ’92, there was very little change. It was pretty, what I called a fully matured bureaucracy. NASA had been around a long time—we’re approaching fifty years—and we kind of got set in our ways, so a lot of processes and a lot of thinking process were kind of set in the way we did business, which is a problem. When you’re doing something new you don’t know everything, and it’s exciting and people are learning and developing, and the process is all changing.\\n\\n The good thing for Shuttle is you had a nice steady process. You do this, you do this, you do this, and you fly a Shuttle. But what had happened during basically since [19]’81 when we first started flying the shuttle, designed it in the seventies, it’s been almost thirty years since we developed a new launch vehicle, so we had gotten completely away from how to develop a human-rated spacecraft. Hadn’t done it. In fact, it’s been almost two generations of engineers, so if you go around NASA it’s really tough to get people who think in the development mind frame.\\n\\n The people we had developing Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were developing all the X-planes that were the first ones to go supersonic and all of that kind of work, and there were dozens and dozens of projects they cut their teeth on. What’s happened in the last couple of years since Mike Griffin has come onboard is to change the culture to start thinking like a group that’s going to design a new spacecraft. So there’s been a huge amount of change in just the last couple of years. We have an administrator who understands how a rocket works.\\n\\n So where we are today is there’s been a huge amount of change in the last couple of years. We have an administrator who is technically competent, and we have a vision, which is something NASA was lacking. One of the things I saw for a long time is NASA really was missing a high-level objective. The Shuttles are amazing vehicles, the [International] Space Station’s an incredible project, we’ve done amazing things in space, but there was no high-level from-the-top goal for NASA to really sink its teeth into. It was more of, do this project, do that program, business as usual.\\n\\n So with the advent of the vision for space exploration, and then with someone who understands the technical realities of what it takes to do a program, and understands the type of organization that it needs to carry out that kind of a vision, there’s been a lot of change in the last couple of years. So I saw a long period of very little change, in fact more of digging in, same old same old, and then the couple of events in the last five years, the vision for space exploration and Mike Griffin coming onboard, changing the basic governance models of how we do business has really begun to turn the boat around, if you will, to get us vectored in the right direction to accomplish this.\\n\\n That’s not to say that it’s all perfect. We still have a long way to go. But it’s the most change I’ve seen at NASA in my career, just in the last couple of years."

        "utterance": "Yes, the way I look at my job is it’s kind of interesting being in this office at NASA Headquarters. I’m kind of a technical guy, too, just like my boss, love technical design, but also understand that there’s a need to explain what we’re doing to all of our stakeholders. One of the reasons we’re sitting in an office in Washington, D.C. is that we have the Congress and the White House. We work for the White House, obviously, the administration, to help keep them all informed as to what it is we’re doing, and why we’re doing what we’re doing, and to be working really hard to improve our credibility.\\n\\n NASA has a problem with its credibility; it’s very low. A lot of people go see a lot of programs and projects that we have started and not finished, a lot of budgets that have been overrun by huge margins, and a lot of it was due to people promising things that they couldn’t deliver on.\\n\\n So my job is to make sure we don’t promise things we can’t deliver on, and make sure I allow the people that work on doing the real work, my program and project managers, to provide what I call the top cover for them. So the way for a program, especially a program of this size and complexity to succeed is they need stable requirements, they need to make realistic assumptions on what technology they’re going to have, and not base things on “unobtanium” as we like to call it, and they have to have a stable environment, which means a stable budget and other things that allow them to operate their programs in a manner that lets them produce the results that we want.\\n\\n So really my leadership, if you will, is to help provide that environment, not allow high-level changes to the requirements, not allow them to base programs and projects on unobtanium technology, and to do everything I can to get them a stable budget environment, and if things change in that environment to make sure that the people that are paying the bills understand the consequences of changes to the budget, and not promise that I can deliver when those changes occur.\\n\\n If you change the amount of money available to do something, you either have to change the content or the time. Something has to change. You can’t keep promising, “Oh yeah, I’ll take a 25 percent cut and we’ll make it happen, thank you very much.” That’s not realistic. So part of my leadership is really just to provide a good environment for the people who do the real work to get the job done. That’s kind of my job."

        "utterance": "We’ve been to the Moon. We’ve been there. We have the technology to go to the Moon. Now, are we going to use the same exact bolts and nuts and screws and computers? No, we’re not. We’re going to take advantage of the existing technology where it makes sense. So one of the things trying to explain to people, for example, the design of this new launch vehicle. The first stage of it is the solid-rocket booster. We’re going to add another segment to it, but it’s basically the same technology. In fact, a larger version had been fired in 2003, so the changes to that are pretty minimal. So that’s a good, cost-effective solution, because that’s a very safe, reliable solution for the first stage.\\n\\n We’re bringing back the J-2 as the J-2X. That flew on Apollo. It will be a better engine. So one of the ways I explain things, it’s like looking at airplanes. People say, “Well, we’ve been there, done that.”\\n\\n And I say, “Well, you’ve been there and you’ve done that with airplanes.” If you go out to an airport and you fly a 737, which you probably flew on your trip up here, you probably flew a 737-800. Well, the very first 737 flew back in 1967. If the two airplanes were parked on the ramp, unless you’re an aero [aerospace] engineer or an airplane buff, you probably couldn’t tell the difference except one’s got little funny things pointed up on the wingtips, and maybe you might notice that the engine looks bigger in diameter on the new one versus the old one. Other than that you wouldn’t know the difference, but they are significantly different aircraft.\\n\\n They’re about the same shape, about the same size, they do the same thing, move people from Point A to Point B, but the new one does it much safer, much more fuel efficiently, and has much more technology embedded in the aircraft. That’s kind of what we’re going to be doing here, is the shape and the basic—the reason the rocket looks the way it does, which is a tall, skinny rocket with multiple stages and a capsule on the top is, that’s what physics drives you to.\\n\\n The physics hasn’t changed, and barring any what people are always trying to bet on, this revolutionary technology, which again remember I said earlier that if you try to bet something on a revolutionary technology you will probably fail if you’re not trying some kind of a technology that has a high level of maturity. So when I try to explain to people I try to relate it in terms that they can understand as to what we’re doing.\\n\\n So really, we’re not doing anything Earth shattering. What we’re doing is we’re trying to do good engineering, good systems engineering, and so this is a big program. It’s a big project, but we’re not violating any of the laws of physics this time, and that’s why we have a high potential of success."

        "utterance": "Yes. When you look at the vision for space exploration it talks about Moon, Mars, and beyond. It’s very clear about that. The Moon is not the goal. The Moon is a step along the way to further human exploration of the solar system, and eventually beyond. We can look how much further beyond? Some people ask will we ever go to Mars? Absolutely we’re going to go to Mars. It’s not a matter of if, it’s a matter of when.\\n\\n If you look at our current budget and you look at what we’ve accomplished, there’s no reason to suspect why in the next fifty years we wouldn’t be at Mars. In fact, given current spending rates, if we do it right one could forecast that we might be at Mars in the 2030-35 timeframe, just looking at the kind of budget if NASA gets about the same money per year, if we don’t go off on a weird track somewhere and try to do something strange.\\n\\n What you’ll see happen is in the next few years we’ll develop the Ares I and the Orion spaceship. We’ll start flying it to Space Station, and then we’ll prepare to go on to the Moon. We’ll build the Ares V, and the Ares V will really change the ability of the United States by allowing us to send a heavy-lift vehicle, which can put on the order of 260,000 pounds in low-Earth orbit. This is actually more than the Saturn V could do. We gave up a fundamental capability, the United States, when we stopped flying the Saturn V back in the seventies. We lost twenty years.\\n\\n So barring making another mistake like that, we will have the basic capability required to go anywhere, because we’ll be able to put up large objects required to go on to Mars and beyond, and beyond will depend on what technology we have to launch on this heavy-lift vehicle. You still have to do the first fifty miles. As was once told to me, the first fifty and the last fifty miles are the hardest.\\n\\n So what I see happening is by 2020 you’ll see us returning to the Moon, but we’re not going to go back—it’s not going to be just to get there and that’s the goal. We will actually go back with a capability we’re designing today that’s much more capable than the Apollo folks enjoyed. We’ll be able to send four astronauts down to the surface, and we’ll have a vehicle that can deliver large amounts of payload to the surface to be able to put some infrastructure in place. We won’t just go to the equator. We’ll probably start out at the poles, and we’re going to build up an outpost.\\n\\n We’re also going to provide an opportunity for other countries to participate, that’s part of the whole strategy, and the commercial world will hopefully be providing us low-Earth orbit capability, and then eventually the commercial world will find a reason to sell services to the Moon, so it will continue to follow as NASA explores. We will be hopefully opening the frontier for the commercial world to follow as they see markets and see fit, because if we can buy services from them more cost effectively, then we can concentrate on the next-harder thing.\\n\\n After we spend some time in the outpost and learn all the lessons we need to go on to Mars, then we’ll start seriously contemplating putting together a Mars mission. We have to solve some problems like, how do you deal with the long exposure of radiation to astronauts, because Mars missions are measured in many of months and a couple of years, versus just a couple of days or months on the Space Station.\\n\\n So I fully expect that you’ll see us starting to go to Mars, particularly in the 2030-ish, [20]35 timeframe, and by the fifties, fifty years from now you’ll see an established Mars outpost and us going to other interesting places in the solar system."

Everyone comes up with these, “Oh, we need a cute theme,” or, “We need a cute poster,” or, “We need some kind of a crazy saying to motivate people.”\\n\\n And my response is, “No. You just need to do great things. If you do great things, you will motivate people because they’re excited.” Putting an outpost on the Moon is exciting, and you don’t have to become an astronaut. There are thousands of people that went into the math and sciences and engineering disciplines that really peaked around the Apollo program, and then at the end of that program we saw that drop off in this country.\\n\\n So the United States is losing its technological edge, and, in fact, in some segments people would claim we’ve lost it, and so maybe one of the greatest things, greatest gifts that this nation can get out of its space program is the fact that we will inspire the next generation to do something that’s even grander than what we’re doing today or doing tomorrow or in the next few years.\\n\\n In fact, one of my biggest fears growing up, especially through high school and stuff as I watched the end of the Apollo program and people were talking about what they were going to do next, is I truly believed that at the rate I watched NASA go, that by the time I was old enough to go to work for NASA that all the cool stuff would have been over, and we would have been on Mars and that would have been done.\\n\\n Little would I have guessed, because if you had looked at the rate at where we were headed, there was nothing to say we shouldn’t have been a big presence on the Moon and off to Mars with a Space Station flying and everything by the eighties. Those were the original projections and I believed it as a kid. But there were some changes in policy and major decisions made that changed that course of history. So I think by picking grand goals and doing exciting things, then we’ll motivate the next generation. That may be the biggest benefit of doing something like this."

For example, I could send a robot out today into a field to go look for fossils, and the chances of that robot finding a fossil are slim to none. It could spend days and days and days and days running around looking for fossils, and probably couldn’t figure them out, where I could just take somebody who knows what to look for to find a fossil, either a trained geologist or just anybody who’s trained in a little bit of basic geology, and they could go out and find a bunch of fossils in an area that had them.\\n\\n There are tasks that require the human mind to make decisions. There are dangerous things you’d rather send a robot to do. There are places that we can’t protect the crew that it’s better to send a robot to. There are robots working with people, and so there’s a whole field of study going on there. For example, you could be at your Moon base, so let’s just fast forward ten years. I fully expect on the Moon base that you’re not going to jump in your suit and run outdoors every day to go do the million things that you want to do.\\n\\n You may have some robots, and you may have a control panel there in your little lunar outpost, and you might send a robot off to go look at some prospective, interesting areas, and do some surveying and all that, and then you might get in your suit or a rover and go out to that area and do some detailed work with a robot helper. So I think you’ll see the collaboration between humans and robots changing all the time, and people need to realize there’s roles for both, but there are huge advantages to having a human in situ."

I have a lot of old NACA reports, and, of course, books on airfoil design and everything that we got from NACA. NASA has four major directorates. We have aeronautics and we have science, we have exploration and we have ops [operations]. I see NASA going forward with a balanced portfolio, and aeronautics has been kind of in the background for a few years and is starting to come around on its own again.\\n\\n There’s a lot of very important work that aeronautics needs to do to support both science and exploration. I’ll give an example. When we come back from the Moon we’ll be going really fast. When we hit the atmosphere we’ll have to design the spacecraft to have a heat shield that’ll be able to maneuver in the atmosphere and reenter, and that requires the knowledge of how a vehicle reacts when it hits the atmosphere at a very high speed. It’s an aero-thermodynamics problem.\\n\\n Well, that expertise resides in aeronautics, so we need smart people in aeronautics to advance that state of the art in their ability to analyze that problem, that really haven’t done so in a lot of years. So there’s some basic aero work we need done now. We’re going to send a Mars surface lab to Mars. Well, it also has an atmosphere.\\n\\n Well, someday we’re going to send people to Mars, and we’re going to need a large vehicle with a fairly good size heat shield, and so actually today the Exploration Mission Directorate, the Aeronautics Research Directorate, and the Science Mission Directorate are working together to instrument the heat shield for the Mars surface lab, to get data for all three directorates, and the aero people will be using that data to update their models and prediction capabilities so we can use them for future vehicles that we design for Mars.\\n\\n We’re also looking in the field of hypersonics, which is a field that I’ve always been fairly interested in. I think it’s a very exciting field, and not a lot of work has been done in that field. In my estimation we could do a lot more, and so we’re seeing more work done in hypersonics.\\n\\n I know that we’re working in aeronautics to help the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] by providing expertise in how to analyze systems that will affect the airplanes that fly in the future airspace. People are always going to want planes that are more efficient, that are quieter, that are safer, and that’s going to require the experts that we used to think about in the old NACA, in the aeronautics. People forget that NASA is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the first A is for Aeronautics. So I think there’s great things for aeronautics to do.\\n\\n Of course now with Lisa [J.] Porter running aeronautics, I think that’s great because I think she gets it. She’s a smart lady and so I enjoy working with her on aeronautics. I’m a closet aero engineer, so I try to sneak to their seminars."

        "utterance": "One of the basic lessons I’ve learned is especially in large organizations, communications is a problem. Most of the issues I deal with day to day can trace their roots to a breakdown in communications. It’s the old, “What we have here is a basic failure to communicate,” line. It’s really tough in large organizations, and we’ve had the advent of Blackberrys and Internets and all that. I’m not sure that’s helped. In fact, in some ways I think that has made it worse. People have gotten sloppy in their communications.\\n\\n In fact, one of our project managers came up with a great suggestion at our last quarterly. You’ll find yourself in one of these e-mail flails, I call them, where suddenly you have forty messages, and I’m not exaggerating, on a topic, and people are talking past each other and it’s getting out of control, and he says at any point, he’s instituted a rule that someone can throw the e-mail flag. Everyone has to stop sending notes and pick up the phone or call a meeting and talk face to face.\\n\\n So what I’ve learned from being at different levels of the organization is that keeping people informed of what’s going on is really important, and so I work hard, I’m not always very successful at it, but try to work hard at making sure information is going both ways, up and out to our stakeholders—they don’t like to be surprised, I don’t like to be surprised—and down and in to the people doing the work so they’re not surprised.\\n\\n In fact, what you usually find most people are upset about is they’ve been surprised, one way or another. Someone found out you were looking at something and they had no idea that you were concerned about this, so they’re surprised. So communications is one big lesson.\\n\\n One of the other lessons I’ve learned is that this agency needs people in leadership positions that have the technical background to understand what it is they’re leading. I don’t care what anybody says, you can’t just go to some school and learn how to be a manager, and expect to be able to manage anything as complex as the space program. It just doesn’t work. And while I have a lot of lessons to learn in management, at least I understand what it is we’re trying to build. I don’t know everything about what we’re trying to build, but at least I know which end of the pointy rocket goes forward, and that F equals MA [Force equals Mass multiplied by Acceleration].\\n\\n You need that. You really do, or you’re not credible to your stakeholders, you’re not credible to people you work for, and you can’t decipher the reams of information that are being thrown at you, that most have a technical basis on which you’re going to make a decision. So I think technical competence in leadership positions is what this agency, more than probably any other agency I know of, needs, because of our particular mission, which is, it is rocket science. It really is rocket science.\\n\\n So those two things from management, the communications and technical competence in leadership is really important, so maybe those are a couple of the top items that I think about."

        "utterance": "Everybody talks about culture. What was missing in Columbia, I think when people are talking about culture was there wasn’t a good flow of information from the right people to the people who had to make the decisions. So you can have people with good technical backgrounds in good decision-making roles, but if they aren’t presented with the right information at the right time, they can’t make the right decisions. So I’ve seen that a lot.\\n\\n NASA’s new governance model is actually very interesting. We have the programmatic chain of command, if you will, and we have the technical chain of command. It used to be mission directorates, which were then called codes, owned Centers. There were Centers that worked for Code M, and there were Centers that worked for Code S, and there were Centers that worked for pick your code. That’s not the way NASA is organized anymore.\\n\\n The new governance model is we have Mission Directorates, and the Mission Directorates have programs. So, Exploration, we are a Mission Directorate and we have programs like Constellation. I have a program manager, and that program manager’s job is to execute the program, and we tell him budget and requirements and, “This is what we need you to go do.” Now, they get technical help and technical expertise from the Centers, so the Center Directors own the bulk of the talent, if you will, to actually do the job. And so the Center Directors don’t work for Mission Directorates anymore. In fact, they’re on the same level in the agency, and so that’s the board of directors, includes the people responsible for the programs and the people responsible for the technical work, which makes sense.\\n\\n So I’ll give you an example of a situation that might arise. The program gets told by the Mission Directorate, I say, “Program manager, I want to launch this rocket tomorrow.”\\n\\n And he goes, “Yes, sir, going to launch that rocket tomorrow.”\\n\\n Now one of his technical guys working for him goes, “Well, that’s the dumbest thing I ever heard. We’re not ready to launch that rocket for—,” pick a technical reason. So he goes to the program manager and says, “You’re full of baloney, don’t want to launch this rocket tomorrow.”\\n\\n And he goes, “You don’t understand. Senator fill-in-the-blank has told the ESMD [Exploration Systems Mission Directorate] guy, ‘You’re going to launch this rocket.’ And he’s told his program manager, me, to tell you to go launch this rocket.”\\n\\n He goes, “Well, I disagree, so I’m going to go tell my management.”\\n\\n So now in one or two phone calls the Center Director is calling me and saying, “That’s a dumb technical solution.”\\n\\n And I say, “You don’t understand the program pressure I’m under.”\\n\\n And he says, “You don’t understand that’s a bad technical solution.” So within two or three phone calls, if you use a phone instead of a Blackberry, we are now meeting face to face to look at the programmatics versus the technical. If we can’t resolve the problem it goes to the NASA Associate Administrator and the NASA Administrator. So in less than half a dozen levels of communication you’ve gone from almost any level in the organization to the top to resolve a serious issue. You always want to resolve the problems at the lowest level, but you need a way to elevate to upper management if required.\\n\\n But if it cannot be resolved, people know there’s a path all the way to the top, where the NASA Administrator can make the final call, and that is a huge, huge difference, and that is a huge benefit of the way we’re organized now, which is completely different than the way the organization worked. Now, it doesn’t work perfectly, and what we’re trying to instill in people is that there is this chain of command. You are expected to be technically competent, you are expected to bring up issues, and so the challenge is teaching everybody their responsibility and how to use that responsibility correctly.\\n\\n So that’s the big challenge now that we’ve given them the framework. It’s now getting everyone to learn how to use the framework. So the cultural issue now is training people how to work in this environment. We want them to be the experts in their field, and we want them to speak up when they need to speak up."

We have to stop doing that, and so we have to be able to lay out a program like we have in the exploration program, that is achievable, doesn’t require miracles, doesn’t use hope as a management tool, and gets back to our basic tenets of technical credibility and excellence, and deliver on the vision for space exploration.

        "utterance": "Sure. Let’s see. Next year I’ll have been at JSC for 30 years. I’m heritage JSC Engineering. By that I mean I’ve spent my whole career in JSC Engineering. I started out working in Space Shuttle and worked my way up doing structures work, and then into the Shuttle Vehicle Engineering Office at JSC on the engineering side.\\n\\n From there, when we had the Columbia accident [STS-107], I went to go work at the NESC, the [NASA] Engineering and Safety Center, for about three years. While I was in the NESC, the early RFPs [Request for Proposals] went out for what would someday become Orion. It was CEV [Crew Exploration Vehicle] at the time. Some of their Phase A activity would have started around 2003, 2004, which would have been when I was at the NESC. They started entering into I guess what would have been Phase B, some of the downselect, and then meetings with at the time Boeing and Lockheed teams. I guess Boeing was partnered with Northrop, I believe. There were two teams that were competing for the downselect, and [at that point I was still] in the NESC.\\n\\n Engineering decided that as the Program Office was forming up at JSC they needed to put a Chief Engineer in that Office, and I was actively lobbying for that job. I wanted that job. Engineering wanted me back in Engineering from the NESC, so I basically told them when they were ready to give me this job, Chief Engineer for Orion, I was willing to come back to Engineering.\\n\\n It was an interesting negotiation, but I eventually got what I wanted. They offered me the job. Charlie [Charles J.] Camarda was the Engineering Director at the time. Steve [Stephen J.] Altemus was the Deputy. They offered me this job and I came back to Engineering into EA4 [organizational code for the Technical Integration Office], which is the organization I’m in today, the Chief Engineer’s Office."

They want them to have an independent adviser who’s really not dependent on that Program Manager for their performance award, not dependent on that Program Manager for their feedback as to how well they did. I think of it more of as an adviser and a peer as opposed to an employee. It’s easier for me to say no in some ways to a Program Manager than it is for a direct report.

        "utterance": "Right, Chief Engineer of the Universe, that’s probably the [more] politically correct [version of the] way that we used to refer to Mike. Mike is a great guy, and he was super smart. Having an Administrator that was that interested in your Program was very much a double-edged sword. As Chief Engineer I loved the fact that Mike was interested and engaged and current on what our technical challenges were. Like all engineers, he had his own thoughts about how things should be designed and done. Sometimes that could be a little bit of a challenge for us. Sometimes he was right, and sometimes he wasn’t right, just like all engineers. It got to be a bit of a challenge.\\n\\n It’s funny that you mentioned you interviewed Carol. For me personally one of the things I went round and round with Mike about was whether or not the crew module should be composite. It’s metal now. It’s aluminum alloy. We went round and round about whether it should be composite because of mass savings. Typically if you can create the fuselage out of composite it would be lighter. The problem with our crew module is the shape [and the environments it’s exposed to], and also it has so many cutouts and penetrations in it. Typically what they’ll tell you, just rule of thumb, if it’s got a whole lot of penetrations in it—that’s not very technical—the trade on mass isn’t as favorable. You’ve really got to go do the math to see which is better.\\n\\n When I first came onto Orion I can remember arguments with Mike—conversations with Mike, differences of opinion with Mike. You don’t argue really with the Administrator. We would literally be in a room with a bunch of people, and the engineers would be telling him, “It doesn’t trade favorably; it doesn’t trade favorably.” He was just absolutely adamant that we needed to be composite.\\n\\n Carol eventually wound up leading a trade study with the NESC. The NESC did a runoff between metallic and composite. The NESC even went so far as to build up a full-scale pressure vessel out of composite and test it. They were advancing a lot of different things, advancing the way we did analysis with composites and advancing some of the materials we used and some of the test methods. They were doing some pretty advanced composite stuff in conjunction with this demonstration. They had some other objectives as well, but basically we were trying to see if it would be lighter.\\n\\n In the end it didn’t wind up being lighter. Then you’d be really careful about telling the Administrator, “I told you so.” You just go, “Well, look, here’s the data. What do you want us to do?” “[Make] it out of metal, fine.” Carol worked that really hard and spent a lot of time convincing him that really composite wasn’t better. It was really a mixed blessing [having that level of engagement].\\n\\n I will say I actually in some ways miss the interaction we had with Mike. Mark and I would be in Washington, DC—I’m sure he told you—we’d be in DC, if not every couple weeks, at least once a month, sometimes two or three times a month to talk to him about the details of the systems engineering. Obviously he’s really interested in systems engineering, so how we were doing the systems engineering trades and what the data was indicating.\\n\\n In some ways I miss that because it was great to have that much interest and visibility. He is a good engineer. Getting good interaction at the engineering level with the Administrator is certainly not something you’re going to see with every Administrator, so I miss that. It did drive you crazy when he came in and said he wanted you to change your architecture."

That wasn’t what I was looking for.\\n\\n I wanted to go and do development, and this was going to be a development program from scratch basically. You were going to get to follow that development process all the way from requirements and contract award and government design requirements and analysis cycles, which is the real early stuff that’s done even before the contractor does a lot of their work. Then it carries typically through the early phases of the contractor work, where you’re balancing government work against contractor work, and trying to find your way through the requirement and design trade space and finally settle on what that design is that you’re going to go build. You get to see the whole thing start to finish, which I had never seen in Shuttle.

Maybe 2007 the honeymoon was over, and you really knew a lot about the design, say that summer of 2007. We would have been pushing through the system requirements review process and realizing that while it looked good on paper—here’s a good example, because this is what we were facing at the time. It was very heavy. This design looked great on paper, it was very robust, but as they were populating the design space with more and more detail we were figuring out how heavy the vehicle was.\\n\\n As they laid in more and more detail, “Oh, we forgot this,” and “oh yes, the structure has fasteners,” and “oh, by the way, we had to adjust the margin because of the loads.” They did all this, then all of a sudden the vehicle is like 10,000 pounds overweight. You’re trying to get through your system requirements review and your system design review process, and you have to show a credible design, and the vehicle is way overweight. We had a lot of detail, but not everything in that detail was telling us a good story."

I was just curious what drove that design for reusability. That’s how the Shuttle was sold to reduce cost, but it didn’t really end up reducing cost in the end. I’m just curious about that idea behind that."

        "utterance": "Right. I would even say CEV, reusability is a hot and cold thing. Everybody wants it, because they think it’s the panacea for life cycle cost and in a lot of cases it’s not. Either it’s not as reusable as you think it’s going to be or the refurbishment costs wind up driving you out of the box, and it’s just better to buy something new. Where Orion is settled at now—it’s been through a whole spectrum of more and less reusability over the years. When I first came on board, some of the concepts were landing on land and basically coming and picking it up and sending it back to the manufacturing facility and refurbishing it and flying it, more like Shuttle I would say.\\n\\n But over the years we’ve figured out that landing on land made us really heavy, so we wound up going back to landing on water, which has its own implications from a life cycle cost perspective. One of the things you really sacrifice when you land in water, if you can’t control where the water goes, is some of the reusability aspects. Right now there are some reusability aspects of Orion that are on the wait and see level. That’s a little bit the way Apollo did it.\\n\\n Apollo went through their first several flights and towards the end of the Program was actually looking at, we really could be reusing more of this hardware if we put a few seals here or adjust this aspect of the design. We could keep water from intruding, and we would be able to reuse more hardware. Right now Orion is basically at the point where we know we’re going to reuse all the internal avionics. Actually that’s where a lot of the money is. If you look at say 30 years ago or 40 years ago when Shuttle was built, a lot of the money was in the airframe, the manual labor that went into machining and building up this aircraft body. The money on Orion now is in the cost of the avionics boxes.\\n\\n If we can reuse all the avionics boxes, which we should be able to, because they’re all sealed inside the pressure vessel with the crew, that means they’re always climate-controlled and we keep the water out of the pressure vessel. We keep all the bad things out of the pressure vessel because of the crew anyway, these boxes are maintained in a short sleeve environment for the most part, then we should be able to reuse them with very little effort. Fortunately for us that’s a good intersection of where the cost is as well.\\n\\n We’ll start there. I think there will be a movement over time to want to be able to reuse more. Maybe reuse the airframe, the pressure vessel itself. But right now, some of the numbers we’re thinking about to do the refurbishment, it’s just easier, cheaper just to build a new one. We’ll find I think that sweet spot over the first say half a dozen flights to optimize cost and salvage as much of the hardware as we can, because we know it’s all real expensive. So we’ll continue to work that."

        "utterance": "Sure. That’s a great question. Yes, because I think it’s important for the historical record, I’ll tell you the truth, 10 healthy Centers is a pain in the butt. That’s what Mike wanted. From the very beginning Mike Griffin was very clear that we would be a multi-Center Program. Again there’s positives and negatives that come with that. Orion is living proof of that.\\n\\n The benefit we get obviously is we get to bring all the expertise from all the Centers. When you bring people from the Centers, you bring an investment and an interest of their institutions and their Centers in the success of Orion. I think that’s huge for maintaining enthusiasm for the Program and support for the Program, not just political support but just Agency support. The more Centers are involved, the more Centers that feel like they have skin in the game, then you have better support within the Agency, even though I think a lot of it comes from political support as well. But I feel it’s true even at the Engineering and Program level. That commitment you feel at the Agency level, because it’s spread around to the Centers.\\n\\n But it’s a pain in the butt. The engineering team is a big engineering team, and they are spread across 9 of the 10 Centers. I’m trying to think. I have chief engineers at five of the Centers to help manage that because just the geographic distance can make communication difficult. These teams are trying to solve complicated problems. They’re passing data and models back and forth, which of course wouldn’t be possible if we weren’t where we are technologically today to be able to pass all this information back and forth across servers and across the Internet and be able to communicate. We’re much more telecon-oriented. Our guys don’t think anything about a phone call that’s got people from six different Centers. You’re trying to balance the time zone differences, and of course that’s got its own challenge with Europe as well but even within the United States with the different Centers managing the time zone issue. I would say as a net technically, it’s a good thing. From a management perspective, boy, it’s a hassle.\\n\\n You are very correct when you say each Center has its own cultural bias. I honestly believe that what got me this job, notwithstanding the fact I pestered them to death until they gave it to me, was the fact that I had been at the NESC. Not only had I been in the Chief Engineer’s Office and worked in Shuttle for a decade, or by that point almost two decades, but was the fact that I spent the last three years in the NESC. As a founding member of the NESC and [leading what was, at the time, the Mechanical Analysis] Technical Discipline Team, I was forced to make contacts at all 10 Centers. This was a part of my job. That was my job, to go establish what was the community of practice for my discipline at all 10 Centers.\\n\\n I had to contact each Center. Of course I had good contacts already in the manned spaceflight Centers. I spent a lot of time working with Kennedy Space Center [KSC, Florida] and spent a lot of time working with Marshall Space Flight Center [Huntsville, Alabama]. Those were fairly easy. As part of the NESC I got to know a lot of people at Glenn [Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio] in particular, which was a huge benefit for me as Chief Engineer for Orion. I still leverage today, a decade later, people that I met in the NESC.\\n\\n Several people that were with me in the NESC at that time and worked studies with me at the time, including a “ Smart Buyer activity” for Orion, which was my last NESC activity before I came to Orion; we had looked at some alternate architecture concepts within the NESC. I met a lot of people from Glenn, a lot of people from Langley [Research Center, Hampton, Virginia] that were tremendously influential as we set up these multi-Center teams. You’d have to be able to call somebody within the engineering institution at Glenn and say, “This is what I need. Do you have it? What’s the priority?”\\n\\n Quite frankly, when you start talking to another Center about what their priorities are, that can be really touchy. You have to have someone that you can call and say, “Hey, look now. We were all in the NESC together, so don’t lie to me about what your priorities are.” You have this network of people that you can call on, and you trust them to tell you, just because of your shared past history, “Here are the obstacles I’m facing in trying to meet your need.” You figure out how to help each other.\\n\\n I honestly think if I hadn’t been at the NESC they probably wouldn’t have necessarily given me this job. It was a huge leg up knowing that Mike had this 10 healthy Centers mantra that he was pushing. It made a tremendous difference to be able to say I was connected already to all the Centers."

        "utterance": "Working with Glenn is one of the most obvious, because such a large percentage of our staff is up there working service module. I have very good contacts up there. It can be a really complicated technical problem you can be talking about.\\n\\n I’ll tell you honestly, probably where it is most useful is in the mundane day-to-day staffing challenges. Our propulsion team, we have a propulsion team here at JSC which houses the System Manager and the Subsystem Manager for the crew module. Then we have a Subsystem Manager and a propulsion team at Glenn that handles the service module. We’re perpetually challenged with staffing those teams.\\n\\n We’re hard on the teams. We have a fair amount of turnover. They work really hard; they work long hours, keeping those teams staffed and getting them extra help. Rick [Richard T.] Manella is Chief Engineer up at Glenn. I know him from my NESC days and frequently it’s a matter of just being able to call and say, “Hey, look, this is what’s working. This is what’s not working. We need to be able to apply more resources. My Engineering Director and your Engineering Director need to be able to talk about getting the right staffing in the right place at the right time.” It’s not necessarily very glamorous, but it’s the day-to-day conversations that keep the team staffed and keep us from burning all the engineering teams out, that cooperative work between the institutions Center to Center.\\n\\n Other examples having to do with say, for example, the heat shield on the spacecraft. Very complicated analysis. Over the 10 years I’ve been on Program we’ve switched architectures from what we call a monolithic Avcoat, which is what Apollo was, to a block architecture. It’s still Avcoat material, but it’s applied in a block. It’s different than Shuttle tiles. If you had that in your mind, that’d be close enough.\\n\\n That process of switching architectures required a lot of very complicated analysis. When you look to Lockheed Martin, who was trying to lead the change to block architecture for a lot of very good reasons, they struggled with being able to do all the analytical work that was required to substantiate the change. We were able to reach out to Langley in this particular case, who we go to for a lot of our structures needs and loads needs, because it’s a very deep bench at Langley and a long heritage of doing structures work there. They supplied us.\\n\\n Just basically I call them and say, “Hey, I need more help.” I knew several people in the management chain there. Clayton [P.] Turner was at the time further down in the engineering chain. I could call Clayton, because I knew him and had known him for years based on time at the NESC, and was able to call him and say, “Hey, Clayton, look, I need guys that can do this kind of work.” They’re doing these very sophisticated nonlinear analysis runs basically for Lockheed to help feed back into the Lockheed design process to help enable the switch to this architecture.\\n\\n It’s a very collaborative process between the Centers, trying to get the critical skills right across the Program and being able to surge resources on and off the Program. Because the last thing Mark [A.] Kirasich wants today and that Geyer wanted before him—the worst thing for them would be to say, “I’m going to build up this huge engineering team,” and then they have to continue to pay for that team for all time. That makes it really expensive.\\n\\n We would try to manage those resources and basically go out and borrow. Surge on to Program, when we needed people and then shed them back out to the Centers and institutions when we didn’t. That can be really complicated planning from a staffing perspective. A lot of conversations between myself and Engineering at the other Centers and with the help of the Engineering Directorate here at JSC, how we manage those resources and we bring them on and off Program to deal with whatever the Program’s critical skills issues were at the time."

        "utterance": "It’s got good sides to it, but it makes it a lot more labor-intensive, just the managing of the day-to-day engineering logistics and communication. There were some ground rules that Geyer and I established early on. We talked a lot about it, how he wanted to do his engineering support. One of the ground rules we came to was that all System Managers would reside at JSC. That’s still basically true a decade later. Each subsystem, like structures or prop [propulsion] or ECLSS [Environmental Control and Life Support System], they have a lead engineer. That person on the government side is called the System Manager, much like same nomenclature that was used in Station. We used the nomenclature Subsystem Manager in Shuttle, the same premise. It’s the lead institutional engineer for that discipline that manages that system and its system product team, which manages the interaction with the contractor, manages the interaction among the NASA community, the crew and S&MA [Safety and Mission Assurance] and Engineering. They orchestrate that interaction.\\n\\n That System Manager, Geyer wanted that person at JSC, because that is the initial first point of contact for that discipline from the Program. If he needed to be able to look that person in the eye or have that person in the room, they were here at JSC. Once you got below the System Manager, it spreads out all over the country. A lot of the Subsystem Managers, which is the next tier down, are at Glenn and Langley. I think we even have one at Ames [Research Center, Moffett Field, California]. We have some at Marshall. That has pretty much held fast for the decade that I’ve been there. There is in fact one exception, and that is solid rocket motors. The solid rocket motors that are on Orion, the System Manager is at Marshall, because there was no point in us trying to manage that here at JSC. We tried for a while to have it all under a Propulsion System Manager, but the scope was just too big for any person to reasonably do that job. A couple years in we split it out to Marshall. There’s been no real issues with that. The desire to keep the System Manager located with the Program Manager has continued to be a ground rule for the Program.\\n\\n Of course I like that too, because it keeps them collocated with me, makes my job easier too for the same reasons. Those are the kind of things you have to think about when you’re trying to manage that inter-Center team. How much of that do you allow to migrate out to the Field Centers? It does complicate just day-to-day interaction."

Maybe it’s part and parcel to to some extent the ebb and flow and coming and going of contracts. In a contractor world, that’s the name of the game and part of the business. Their immediate reaction was certainly not positive. They were like, “Okay, this is really bad,” but they immediately set the gears turning with their lobbyists, finding out what was going on, and why and what could be done, and already talking about how things could be restructured or salvaged. They were way ahead, and then certainly they were talking to Mark about a lot of that I’m sure.\\n\\n But the rest of us, I don’t think I would be exaggerating it to say, had waited our whole careers to do this job. We’re thinking who’s going to novate a contract, nobody, so we’re going to build this thing. We’re going to build this sucker, it may take us a little longer, but we’re going to build it. We’re going to do this thing that we had always wanted to do, which was cradle to grave do the development and build this spacecraft. And, at the time, go back to the Moon, a rocket scientist’s dream to do that.\\n\\n I personally was devastated. I don’t think it would be exaggerating to say I was devastated. I think a lot of people were. I don’t think the government guys handled it very well. A lot of us went drinking, quite frankly, and said, “Well, what now?” I would say for that first 24 to 48 hours I think a lot of the government folks were in a “Wow! I wasn’t expecting that, what now mode.” I think to some extent I do give Lockheed a ton of credit for pulling us out of that funk, for no other better term, to say, “Hey, look, there are still options. Let’s talk about what those options are.”\\n\\n I’m sure I have a very selective recollection of that, because it was very traumatic. It seemed to me 24, 48 hours before we regrouped and started talking about what options were really available to us, and then Mark regrouped the NASA senior management team, “Okay, here’s what we’re going to have to start doing and keeping the team moving forward.” I think a phrase uttered very frequently was, “Head down and color. Don’t look up. This too shall pass. Just head down and color, folks. Don’t pay any attention to what you’re hearing.” That’s hard. It’s all over the local news; it’s all over the Internet. You’ve got people within the executive branch openly battling with the legislative branch about your Program. This thing that you’ve invested at this point four, five years of your career working on, and feel like you’re really close. Watching them openly discussing your future in not a positive way was tough. It was very tough."

        "utterance": "Right. I think the most obvious options became what was EFT [Exploration Flight Test]-1. Shed some content, show progress quicker, which seemed to be everyone’s gripe, look at the money that’s been spent without progress. I think it’s very hard, unless you were a part of the perspective from the beginning—of course whether that poisons you or not I don’t know, ruins your objectivity.\\n\\n Mike Griffin had a vision, right or wrong, that this vehicle was to be the once-in-a-lifetime investment, the be-all end-all perfect spacecraft first time off the line. We were going to build this vehicle and the first unit, first serial number 001, that rolled off the assembly line was going to be the configuration. It was going to have all the bells and whistles that we wanted to do exploration for the next 30 years.\\n\\n There was a lot of rewinding and doing again. Mike’s ideas, but not just Mike’s ideas. I want the power system done this way, or I want this attribute of the design to be this thing. If we wanted it to be perfect the first time it was coming off the line, there was by necessity a lot of rewickering and redesigning. That took a lot of time, and it cost a lot of money.\\n\\n When some of the criticisms were “Look at the money that’s been spent and the lack of progress,” we certainly didn’t see it as lack of progress. We felt like we had a ton to show for the money that had been spent. I think in the end the work that occurred that maybe a lot of people don’t subscribe value to, I think was tremendously valuable to us as an engineering team. But that’s neither here nor there.\\n\\n Most of the plans were anything that could show demonstrable progress in the shortest period of time. Progress was of course smoke and fire because this is NASA, so you had to launch something. It really didn’t matter as much what you launched as that you launched something. You reverse-engineer, if I can launch this on a certain date with the engineering value associated with that, which sounds a little bit weird but in some ways was true. What were the fundamental pieces that we already had in place and knew the primary structure? The heat shield—things that would have value if you could demonstrate them now. You weren’t going to roll off the assembly line with the final vehicle.\\n\\n But now we’re at a different place. Mike Griffin is gone, and the mantra is more about this design, build, test, fly, redesign, build, test, fly. It’s this iterative design cycle. Honestly either way works, quite frankly. In some ways as an engineer I find where we are today easier, because you build a little, you test a little. You don’t like the result; you start again. You don’t have so much invested that you can’t change it.\\n\\n Lockheed looked at options and brought options and talked to NASA about well, look, clearly people aren’t happy with the demonstrated progress we’re making. So what could we do that everyone would agree would demonstrate that we’ve made progress? Okay, we pretty easily could build the pressure vessel, because the engineering is done. It’s a little heavy. If this were the final design we’d go send it back through a mass reduction activity. Frankly it’s light enough, particularly if it’s not fully populated with all the systems, that we could launch it on an expendable. Okay, well, now I don’t even need a rocket. I can go buy a rocket off the shelf. What mission can I do with that? Would that mission be useful to me?\\n\\n You start looking at it like well, okay, if you can get it out far enough that you can get it in the Van Allen belt, and you can get it out far enough that you start to see the radiative effects of a high speed reentry, got to get out of low Earth orbit, further out to get the speeds up high enough that you start seeing the radiative effects of reentry. So how far can we get the vehicle out? Okay, well, if I can get it out that far, I’m going to test the core avionics for radiation susceptibility. I’m going to test the heat shield under a higher speed reentry than I can get from low Earth orbit. I can test the parachute system. All these high risk attributes of the design, I could burn those down early, learn a lot, show this progress that people are fussing about, and everybody’s happy, for a fraction of the cost of what it would take to go build the final vehicle, in a fraction of the time.\\n\\n That was where EFT-1 wound up coming on the scene. From my perspective—again of course I’m not sure how objective I am—but I think a good success—and certainly from an engineering team perspective, to be able to keep the engineering team motivated and keep them moving. To be able to see the fruits of their labor if you will, do something that hasn’t been done in [four decades], that’s a huge motivator, and has allowed I think more longevity on the team. The team works on something for a decade. If they haven’t flown anything it’s hard to keep them hanging on.\\n\\n EFT-1, tremendous morale booster internal to the Program as well. I would say is a big contributor for how we’ve managed to keep longevity, some of our key engineering folks on Program for as long as we have."

        "utterance": "Until we flew. We were laughing. One of the guys I work with on the heat shield and I were laughing, because the Christmas after the flight was the first Christmas that he and I hadn’t been working basically through the Christmas holiday in four years. We’d get maybe a few days off around Christmas, but then inevitably we were tied up in phone calls and meetings through Christmas and through furlough. Yes, furlough. I worked. A lot of us worked during furlough. It just seemed like one thing after another. If you say what stands out, I probably would rattle off a litany of technical issues that were my favorite technical issues as we built up the vehicle.\\n\\n With those, the amazing effort I think of the people. Funny whatever weirdness you get when people are working all kinds of hours. It was great. The folks were great and obviously highly motivated to get done, so a lot of team bonding.\\n\\n The good things like getting to meet people, to me that all came post EFT-1. They sent me off to go meet the President [Barrack Obama], which was cool. I think regardless of your politics, you got to say meeting a sitting President is pretty cool. That was neat. Of course after the flight, everybody was awesome, everybody that lives in Clear Lake. Of course my dad, he lives in Indiana. He already thinks NASA is awesome, so he thought it was that much more awesome. That kind of stuff.\\n\\n Leading up to EFT-1, it was so busy. You almost couldn’t think about it. I think until we got to the very end. I can remember being there when they rolled out stacked with the Ogives and the LAS [Launch Abort System] attached getting ready to go to the pad.\\n\\n You find yourself taking pictures because you almost can’t even imagine that it’s finally real after all those years and after all the hours and hours and hours of work, just crazy, crazy work, and feeling like you go from one problem to another. I think the one disadvantage of being Chief Engineer, I’m sure Mark experienced this as Program Manager too, people don’t generally bring you the good stuff. It just seems like day after day you’re faced with what turd happened today, what problem is there that’s got to be dealt with. Didn’t frequently take enough time to go look at the good stuff that was happening. Probably fairly seemed like a miracle in my mind that the damn thing was even ready to fly after all that.\\n\\n There was a lot of people making a lot of good progress day to day that we didn’t necessarily see. I would make it a point—and I’m getting back to that right now, because I’ve been out of it for a while—but I would make a point of getting down to the Cape [Canaveral, Florida], if I could swing it, every month, two months at the most, just to literally fly in, maybe talk to somebody about something specific, meet the people working on the vehicle, talk to my Chief Engineer at KSC, just to go down and see the vehicle. Just so I could reground myself “Look at all this progress we’re making; look at where it is in its build cycle.” I’d say, “I’m going to go and hug it.” I’d say, “I’m going to go fly to the Cape and hug the vehicle because I’m tired of this administrative crap you guys have me doing.”\\n\\n I would go do that and I’d come back and inevitably felt better for days, just having spent some time with the hardware. It did seem rather overwhelming sometimes, the day in, day out dealing with the logistics and issues of getting the vehicle ready for flight."

        "utterance": "Yes, ma’am, thank you for remembering. Cece went with my husband. Cece and my husband went to the launch. It was really nice for all the families that got to go, because people were working these crazy hours and it was nice to finally be able to show them what was going on. Matter of fact, the spring break before we flew, so that would have been March of 2014, I took my daughter and husband to the Cape with me for her spring break. Of course I had work to do, but I took them with me and got her in to see the vehicle. So that at that point she could say, “Oh, okay, this is what you’re spending all these hours on.”\\n\\n At that point it looked like a spaceship. You had the pressure vessel, and it had the wiring and the tubing, and the tanks all attached. They didn’t have the backshells on yet but she got to meet the guys that were doing all the work. It was in the clean room at the time, and she could see it through the glass. She actually knew some of the guys that were working on the vehicle, so they’d come to the glass and knock on it and wave to her. I’m like, “Oh, that’s so-and-so, that’s Mr. so-and-so.” She’d be like, “No way.” I’m like, “Yes, he’s in a bunny suit, you can’t hardly tell, but that’s who that is.”\\n\\n She got to walk all around, and she got to see the guys putting the tiles on the backshell. She talked to them about putting the tiles on the backshell. I think it made it a lot more meaningful for her to be able to see why I was always running to KSC, and why I was always going in and out. It was a big help. Then she got to see the launch and see all the excitement. She was out on the causeway with everybody else. Of course I didn’t get to see her during the launch. She saw a lot of people she knew, and she saw a lot of people she didn’t, strangers, people that maybe didn’t even have anything to do with NASA in particular that were there and were excited about the launch.\\n\\n It was a great experience for her and my husband as well. They put up with a lot, so it’s nice to show them what it is that you’re spending all that time doing."

        "utterance": "Right, the first launch attempt, the anxiousness in the room was almost palpable. Everybody was very excited and very anxious and of course hadn’t slept, even though they tell you to sleep. You’re like, “Right, okay, fine,” because the launch attempt was first thing, so by the time you did the count—I think our call to stations was midnight or something. They were like, “Yes, make sure you sleep before you show up.” Of course nobody slept.\\n\\n We were all just wired. Everybody had drunk about a pot of coffee and was very excited and spun up and ready to go. Just couldn’t get the Delta IV off, just couldn’t. We actually kind of thought they were jerking our chain over at ULA [United Launch Alliance]. I think they were running the count and then going, “Oh, hold, hold, hold. Watch what the NASA guys are going to do. This is going to be funny.” We joked that they were just pulling our chain, because we’d get so excited, and then they’d say, “Oh, hold, hold, hold.”\\n\\n I don’t know how many times they did it. We got through that whole process and then they scrubbed. Then you’re like, “Oh. Okay,” just this huge disappointment. I don’t remember any of that with Shuttle. I guess it’s because Shuttle had gotten to the point where it was so common. Quite frankly, typically I worked structures issues, so by the time you launched, most of that was taken care of. I don’t remember that sense of anticipation and the letdown with a scrub with Shuttle. I’m sure some Shuttle people did. I’m sure STS-1, the first few of them, there was a lot of that. That was totally new to me.\\n\\n To me the interesting contrast was then the second night everybody came back, and people had slept more, just because they were exhausted and couldn’t stay awake any longer. How much calmer it was the second night. It’s hard to describe. It almost felt like “Okay, now we’re serious. Let’s go launch.” Just very calm. Everybody was much more laid-back. You felt like there were these points that you knew were the most dangerous in the mission, and so you could feel people hold their breath a little bit. It didn’t have that same kind of energy and angst like the first night did. Of course everybody holds their breath on the launch.\\n\\n As a matter of fact, ULA and Lockheed had tried to indoctrinate us a little bit on the Delta IV Heavy. A lot of us had never worked with a Delta IV Heavy. It has that lovely fire that comes up the side of the Delta IV from the propellant burnoff. They’d showed us videos. They’d shown us launches. They’re like, “Why don’t you come and see a launch? Because you need to see it to know what’s going to happen.”\\n\\n Most of senior management had, by that point, seen a Delta IV Heavy launch, and I told my daughter and my husband. I said, “This is not a Shuttle.” She had seen a Shuttle launch; she had seen two of the last Shuttle launches. Shuttle gets off the pad very fast. It’s got those solids, and for such a big vehicle, it really goes off the pad fast, relatively.\\n\\n Delta IV crawls off the pad, just crawls. We were like the heaviest payload they’d ever flown. They were offloading propellant to make it light enough for us to be able to even get off the pad. It just crawls off the pad. Between the fact that it’s coming off the pad so slow, to somebody who’s used to watching Shuttle, and this big fireball erupts out of the bottom of it from all the excess hydrogen burnoff.\\n\\n My husband, he’s standing at the causeway with my daughter. It has the countdown, and it says it’s launching. Then you see the initial engines light off and everybody goes, “Yay.” And then whatever the appropriate period of time it would have been for Shuttle to make progress, that you’d have seen it was launching, it did not move fast enough. The people were like, “Oh.” And then “Oh, yay,” once it pulled out of the flame. He said, “That flameball came up the side of the vehicle.” He said, “A lot of people were like, ‘Oh, no.’ You told us what to expect, so we just waited.” It was a little angst-inducing for people that weren’t used to watching a Delta IV Heavy launch.\\n\\n That went really well. Then people hold their breath until the separation, and you’ve got the upper stage firings. Those are always reliability anxious points. Then the rest of the mission went pretty seamlessly. Everything went smoothly. We’re watching for radiation upsets. It doesn’t really happen. Yes, there was onesie-twosie things, but nothing like what we thought could have happened. The systems recovered, no problem. We went through the whole mission, and I would say really until we got to the point—I didn’t even really have that much concern about the capsule separating from the upper stage. I’d seen the development work on the pyrotechnic devices. I felt like they were very reliable, so I wasn’t too particularly concerned about that.\\n\\n The process of going through the plasma field and waiting for the vehicle to emerge, there’s just nothing to be said about the angst of having the vehicle in loss of signal. For the minute or minute and 30 seconds that you’re sitting there, and you’ve got nothing coming off the vehicle, that definitely for me was the most stress. Once you got past the initial launch itself, that was the most stress-inducing. You hear people talk about Apollo, waiting for the vehicle to come out of loss of signal and then the cheer that erupts as soon as they regain communication with the vehicle. It was just like they said it was, which was pretty cool. You could definitely feel that sense of camaraderie or parallelism with what they must have experienced when they had Apollo.\\n\\n By then it’s so fast. Then it just goes boom boom boom, and the chutes are out before you can even think too much about it. Then once the chutes are out, you’re really home free no matter what little things might happen like oh, the uprighting bags don’t work the way they’re supposed to. You’re really pretty much home free, and you’ve made it. Once the chutes are out, it’s all good. It was great. It was everything you could have imagined it was going to be after all that work. Then to watch it fly, and fly so successfully, I think everyone was quite frankly shocked.\\n\\n People would say to me, “Was it really as good as it looked?” I’d be like, “Yes, yes, it was. Yes, it was.” We’d like to chalk it up to the fact that we’re so brilliant. We did the work we felt like we were supposed to do to make that happen, but I don’t think any of us could have imagined we would have been so lucky that nothing unexpected really happened. It was good."

Both Marks used to laugh because they were sitting there, their heads in their hands. Just the most horrible thing that could possibly happen would be to crack the pressure vessel. My reaction, I’m a structures guy, so I’m like, “Oh, that’s awesome. I’m going to the Cape, I’ll see you later.” I go running off to the Cape to go work on the pressure vessel. They said, “Man, we haven’t seen you look this happy in years.” I said, “Well, it’s because I know it’s bad, but it’s something where you feel like you can contribute and make a difference and work with the team and get them through it.”\\n\\n Things like that occasionally happened that I was personally able to help them with. The majority of the time it was really just more, “Hey, it’s okay. That’s a good decision. Maybe you don’t have all the data, maybe you would like more data, but you’re not going to get more data.” So helping them make decisions and helping them move through that process.

        "utterance": "Obviously as a part of Mark’s senior management team, I was involved in all those decisions. Yes, I think the original test sequence was six abort tests, two pad aborts, and maybe at one point four ascent aborts [AA]. Very much modeled on Apollo flight test precedent. Over the years that we were with the Program the cost of running that many tests became overwhelming, and the competition between those tests and the mainline flight program for resources became a problem. The Program was constantly asking Engineering to go back and say, “Do we really have to do, do we really have to do, do we really have to do.”\\n\\n To a great extent, I think Engineering would like more tests, would like more data. We always like more data. That’s a joke, but it’s true. We always like more data. I’m never going to say no to somebody who wants to run a big flight test, plus they’re fun. We looked at where we were in terms of our understanding, and what we were trying to prove or validate in those tests, and felt like we were on pretty solid ground with the data we had. PA-1 was a big success, validated a lot of models and analysis.\\n\\n I’m sure Don would have talked to you too about AA-2, the last of the ascent abort tests. We cut one, and then we merged the remaining two into a single test. Originally we envisioned doing max dynamic pressure and Mach 1 as two separate test points. For Orion they happen to be pretty close in time in the ascent trajectory, so we merged them into a single test, which is AA-2 now. I’m a big proponent of AA-2, and we’ve had to fight to even keep it in the baseline, because a lot of people feel like “Well, our models are good enough. We can do everything by analysis, and we don’t have to validate this capability.”\\n\\n I know I think I speak for a lot of people in Engineering, and I know I speak for Don when I say we feel like it’s our job to demonstrate that this vehicle has robust abort capability. It’s one of the fundamental tenets of going from a winged vehicle to a capsule, to be able to provide robust abort capability in case something went wrong. Those ascent abort and pad abort tests are important. While we understand the Program’s constraints on budget, just couldn’t tolerate cutting AA-2 and even in the last couple years had some pretty significant push and pull with the Program on trying to keep it on schedule.\\n\\n I worked with the Program recently on an initiative over the last couple years to move the AA-2 work principally to a government function rather than contractor function. It’s more easy to fence those resources and fence that work on the government side and protect it and ensure that that test gets done. Really important that that ascent abort test get done. It’s under constant attack, because when you look at the budget it’s an obvious source of money. When your main objective is EM [Exploration Mission]-1 or EM-2, AA-2 looks a bit like a detour or looks like something that’s sucking money and resources off that main line, particularly when it was at Lockheed. I used to call it the piggy bank that they would take money and resources from when they ran short on the mainline Program. AA-2 became the piggy bank. Pulling it off Lockheed’s plate and putting it over on the government side, it’s a little bit easier to protect it, which I think is important. Those guys are making great progress, and I’m looking forward to seeing them fly here in a couple years."

        "utterance": "It was in the year 1992. It got started with the NASA management and [Daniel S.] Goldin originally reaching some agreements to do at that time it started off as one flight. There was going to be Norm's [Norman E. Thagard] flight, and it was kind of equal in the sense that each country would contribute. Our American astronaut would get launched on the Soyuz launcher and go up to Mir. It was kind of a follow on to the Apollo Soyuz [Test] Program, because it was going to try out the new docking system, and we would dock with the Mir station. At the same time, we would take a Russian cosmonaut up on the Shuttle. So we'd have an American astronaut go up on the Russian rocket and then we'd have a Russian cosmonaut go up on the Shuttle, and then we'd prove out and jointly develop this docking system.\\n\\n Initially that was all that was thought of, was just the one mission similar to like we did for Apollo Soyuz, where there was just one flight mission and that was it. But before that mission got under way very far, then it was decided to expand the program to be what we refer to as the Phase One Program for Space Station, and we ought to gain experience by having more of our astronauts up there on longer duration missions. At the time, as you may have heard from Jim Nise, there was a contract developed between us and the Russians that would cover the Phase One Program and some of Phase Two.\\n\\n And also in the fall of that same year, of '92, they decided to organize the joint program similar to the way we organized the program back in the Soyuz Apollo, because that was very successful, where we formed technical working groups. We had co chairmen of those working groups. Then I got selected by Charlie Harlan, who was my boss at that time, because of my previous work with the Russians on the Apollo Soyuz Program, to be the joint co chairman of what we referred to as the Safety Assurance Working Group."

One of the first assignments I had was to develop a safety policy statement for both countries, and so myself and Boris Sotnikov, who is my Russian counterpart, we worked together and developed this joint policy statement that then became the beginning oversight of what we would do safety wise for each country.\\n\\n Then we had our first meeting. We started telecons with our Russian counterparts in the fall, and then we had our first meeting actually in Russia with them in April of '93. I'll give credit to my Russian counterpart. He had put together, on one sheet of paper, an organization of how we could organize the safety work. That shows up in the diagram here. It's best to probably show you. I immediately accepted the Russian concept for organizing our work, because it made a lot of good sense and it served us very well. What it consisted of was, on one diagram, it shows blocks with flow diagrams. It showed, on one side in the actual document he provided, it showed little symbols, but it showed what the Russian side would be responsible for, what the NASA side would be responsible for, how these documents would interrelate, with the final being a Certificate of Readiness for Flight."

        "utterance": "With respect to safety. And the very first document and the document shown in the middle were the ones that we would jointly develop together. The others would be developed by each other, but they were all, of course, signed. The first one became the actual policy and guidelines for the whole program, and it also outlined these various documents and how they relate. We started off by developing a set of requirements for each other and of compliance to those requirements, instead of joint.\\n\\n What I mean by joint is, in our safety analysis, initially we had to do a lot of work because the Russians don't have a formalized safety process like we do, which we refer to as a hazard analysis, where you identify a hazard like fire, for example, and you would outline what all could cause fire electrical, chemical reaction, thermal heat sources, any of those and then we list what are the controls. In the case of electrical, we identify the fact that we have circuit breakers on all of our wiring and it's insulated and it's protected from arcing or shorting. Then you have a list of verifications on those controls. And how do you know that that's in place? And we'd reference testing and what have you.\\n\\n So it took us a while to explain that process to the Russians, because they weren't familiar with doing it, but they quickly adopted that process, and that process is used in these documents. The thing that the Russians brought to the table is they organized our whole set of documents, how they'd be interrelated, who was responsible for what documents, how they would interrelate. That's served us very well in the program.\\n\\n In the case of the fire, we have the one document. For example, when we are docked together, if you had a fire, then the controls for that take into account that both crews must react. In other words, when we were separate, the astronauts would take care of the Shuttle and the Russians would take care of the Mir. But once we're docked, each crew has to do something. The Shuttle guys have to do something. The Mir guys have to do something to counter that.\\n\\n So those hazards and those controls were in this joint document. We eventually wound up with a Certificate of Flight Readiness. We developed that very early with them, and that's served us well. It's one of the few sets of documents developed by the working groups that management signed on all sides. I think that does a couple of things: it shows the significance that both countries and the management [placed] on safety and the fact that those documents would be signed by the higher managers in the program. And we've been fortunate that both the Russian and the U.S. managers have been very strong about making sure we had a good, safe program in place.\\n\\n The other thing he [(Russian counterpart)]showed on the sheet of paper was the schedule of those products and everything. So I thought that was very clever that something we, on the U.S. side, would take maybe a book to explain documents and the contents and who's responsible for what he showed on a simple sheet of paper all of that information. I thought that was very actually profound.\\n\\n One of the cultural things with the Russians and it's been a struggle for us the people in the U.S., we always [tend] to write everything down. In other words, before I remember anything, when somebody tells me about something, if I really want to retain it, I need to write it down. And we're always taking written exams in school and so forth. The Russians, on the other hand, everything's done orally. All their exams are orally. All of their instructors give oral briefings. There's very little in the way of textbooks or written material. Our astronauts have had a problem with that when they go to Russia to train, because everything's provided oral[ly] and they've having to [take] oral exams. We're used to doing everything in writing.\\n\\n The Russians, at the same time, have trouble understanding why we have to have everything written down. I didn't understand that till Shannon [W.] Lucid came back. She said when she was on the Mir, they would tell her something and she'd say, \"Wait a minute. Let me write it down.\" They said, \"No, you don't have to write it down. You remember it.\" And they don't understand our concept of how for us to really remember something, we need to write it down, and that's the way we've been raised. In their culture, because, from little [childhood]on, everything's been oral, their memory retention for verbal is much better than ours. I'm always amazed. My counterpart you tell him something, he'll remember it. I have to write it down. He doesn't have to write it down. So in their case, they're extremely efficient with how they use paper. They have very little of it. They don't understand why we have so much of it. But we both work together.\\n\\n I think the other key to working with them, of course, was walking in with an open mind and my counterpart was this way, too about trying to learn what's best from each other and apply it. It wasn't a case that, \"Mine's best. You've got to do it my way.\" It was trying to listen. Just like the management concept here. When I first saw Boris lay that out, I wasn't going to argue, \"That's the way we ought to do ,\" you know, because we did have a plan on how we thought we would do our work. But I could see right away a far superior way, and I adopted that concept. Likewise, he learned to understand the way we did safety analysis and agreed that that's how we'd do our safety analysis. So we both took something from each other to develop the program, and it's worked out real well."

I was responsible for the electrical wiring and cabling related to the TV cameras that we were going to carry over to the Russian Soyuz vehicle. That working group mainly dealt with TV and communications and so forth, and I had a small piece of it. But I worked with my Russian counterparts, with their electrical systems, and so we got to know each other very well.\\n\\n It was a lot more difficult then, because they were very close with what they told us it was difficult to get information about their systems. They were very close about what they they would provide [unless] there was a real strong understanding that that was really needed in order for us to accomplish our mission. But they were very reluctant to give out information compared to what we were. Of course, back then their society was very stringent. Also they were watched the whole time they were over here, and they were being even monitored in our meeting. So they themselves had to be very careful, and if they felt somebody was getting too friendly, they might get punished by not allowing that person to come back over on another trip or whatever. So it was kind of a strained relationship.\\n\\n But at the individual working level, we really got to know each other. It was engineer to engineer. So even though it was a different language, we could communicate well. We really got to like one another, and so one of the big things that I enjoyed when I finally got back to Russia was getting to meet some of the people I had worked with twenty years before, and vice versa."

They did copy the Shuttle. They were directed by their military at that time to copy the Shuttle, to cut down the time. It wasn't their choice. I deal with some of the others that are working on Space Station in some areas, but they're still working in engineering area versus the safety reliability area that I'm in now.\\n\\n The other thing I was fortunate in when I was back on the Soyuz Apollo, our working group was one of the few working groups that got to go to the Baikonur site, which was very difficult to get into at that time. Tom Stafford and the crew had to almost refuse to fly or something before we were allowed to be in, and most of the time I was over there that first time, we were actually working at the launch site."

        "utterance": "I think, of course, going to the longer duration program was a major turning point, because we were going to be working together. It wasn't like we were going to work together a short time and finish that job and go on to something else; we were going to work over multiple missions. So I think that allowed us to be thinking more of a long term role.\\n\\n I think the other factor was, of course, the things we gained from being in space a long time with the [Russians and] probably, the cultural. The Cold War. Not having the Cold War there was a major thing, because it was a lot freer. They felt more free to talk with us. However, it was still more reserved, even then, at the beginning. The Russian culture, is they have to know you real well and learn to trust you before they ever develop a [relationship] so it's very important, when you're working with them, don't say that you're going to do something or commit to something unless you yourself personally know that you're going to be able to carry that out, because if you just say something to reach agreement and you're really not able to carry it out, then, of course, they're going to lose that trust in you. So I was always very careful about making sure that when I made a commitment, I knew I could carry it out. And so we developed a strong area of trust.\\n\\n The other factor that was a turning point was, I invited them in my home on a social basis to meet my family and eat with me. The Russian culture is such and I was aware of this that they need to get to know you [at] more of a personal level. Also they're more concerned about what all you did when you worked. They rely heavily on experience and somebody having worked on important things. So they want to know a lot about you. Once they had met my family and knew that, of course, the other thing that helped me was having known that I had worked with them back on Soyuz Apollo. That kind of broke the ice. They were a lot more free about providing information. It may not necessarily [be] written down, but they always answered all of my questions I would ask about something. And, of course, I tried to be very open with them. So I think that was kind of a little breakthrough there when you culturally get to understand and trust each other. Then it's a lot easier to work.\\n\\n The TTI interpreters often laugh a lot when they're interpreting, because Boris and I have worked together so closely and think so much alike that when there's a big discussion and we'll usually try to come in to settle it or decide on something, Boris will say, \"Let's do this,\" and I'll say, \"Let's do this.\" I'll be, of course, in English and he's in Russian. And the interpreters will sit there and look back and forth and say, \"You guys are saying the same thing.\" And that happens a lot with us. We just think a lot alike and worked a lot like that. So that's been a big help.\\n\\n The other big breakthrough and I'm sure others will mention is when we had these major problems on board Mir. It forced us to work closer together. The other thing was when we flew the Russian docking module on that second mission. That was a major piece of hardware that had to go through our safety process over here, like any of the other people do. They had come over here a lot and then defend their design. They're not used to doing that. That was something. And then, of course, they had to deal a lot with our KSC [Kennedy Space Center] and how we process hardware at the Cape. So it was a big change there.\\n\\n But then the problems we had on Mir, after the fire and then later because of the depressurization event, they were a lot more even more so open about sharing information. Prior to that, our safety philosophy has been that when the cosmonaut's on the Shuttle, we're responsible for safety. When our astronaut's on the Mir, they're responsible for safety. So we didn't, let's say, review or critique or get heavily involved in each other's vehicle. We only did this safety analysis I told you about, the formal safety analysis, when the two vehicles were actually on mission and were joined together because we're both affected.\\n\\n Well, because of the fire and so forth, and a lot of concerns, we changed. We even made a change to our safety policy that said, well, because we have an American astronaut up on the Mir all the time, we need to know more about what you're doing and the problems you're having and be involved in working those. So that forced a closer, if you want to call it, relationship. And the Russians themselves recognized, \"Hey, we've got to work together more on this. We're in this together. The more information we give you guys about what we're doing and so forth, the better you're going to be able to answer the congressmen and other folks that are concerned about this.\" So those were major points in the change in the way we're doing business and the way we're doing work and all."

It was more what we refer to, that the flight controllers use, about [off nominal]_____ procedures or something like that. Well, this radio quits; you switch over to the redundant radio or so forth. It was not a case of like our process where you and identify all of the hazards: collision, fire, etc., the major ones and then list all the causes and then go down the list and make sure you've got controls, [for] all of them, and verifications.\\n\\n Their point was that if they had a real good design, they didn't worry about the \"what if\" about if that tank were to rupture. They'd have said, \"Well, we've got a very good design. We won't worry about it.\" Whereas our safety analysis, you'd always say, \"Hey, look. What if that breaks and spills the fluid out? What's the controls we have? What's the safety factor on the tank? And even if it does break, what do we do about it?\" There was that difference in philosophy. And the Russians themselves, I was surprised when they were giving a talk over here, they indicated that our safety process was a preventive type of analysis versus a reactive, which is the way theirs was.\\n\\n What we've been doing in the program safety wise is, besides that analysis, particularly since those accidents, anytime the Russians want to do an experiment let's take this last one like the Inspector that they were going to fly around the Mir we did a separate review along with them to make sure that the controls were in place, if it didn't work it wasn't going to collide with the Mir, and so forth. And some of that goes back to well, it does go back to when the Progress had the collision, because we were not involved in that special test they were going to do. We weren't consulted. We weren't asked. In retrospect, if we'd have been involved or when we look at some major task, we make sure the crew's trained, and we get all these things in place and so forth. They really hadn't done that. So we've insisted, since that point in time, that anytime they plan to do anything new or different, that we both review that. And they've seen the benefits of that.\\n\\n We developed safety criteria. There was a lot of this talk about, \"Okay, are we going to allow the next guy to stay on the Mir?\" So we jointly developed a set of and I don't know if it's in this document; I can provide it if it's not we developed a set of criteria that says you've got to have redundant oxygen generation systems, you've got to have at least your thirty day spare supply of food [and] water. It was a set of criteria. The temperature conditions ought to be such and such. It's a set of criteria that says this all has to be working and those conditions have to be in place before we'll allow an astronaut to be over there on a long term basis. So we actually developed a joint set of criteria, as we call it, and we assess that before each one of the flights, to make sure that they've got the redundant carbon dioxide removal system working, they've got the oxygen generation system, they've got spare food, spare water, and so forth, and make sure now all that's in place before we allow an astronaut to go across. There wasn't really a formal review of all that beforehand."

So they send that in to us so we can track that and make sure.\\n\\n We do make allowances. For example, they have spare hardware. So we do allow that if one of the oxygen generation systems quit, that there's allowances made to replace it or fix it. So it's not like, \"Oops. We're not going to go across if you don't have two of those.\" As long as there's oxygen generation capability there and they have the spare hardware on board and they know how to fix it and so forth, and it's just a matter of time, we allow for that. So there's a clause in there that says, \"Given you can maintain it or replace it or so forth, that's allowable.\" So there is some allowance in that regard. Of course, on the station, unlike the Shuttle, it's up there all the time. Things are operating slowly. There's plenty of time to go fix things or repair things."

Bob Peercy and the Boeing North American people, which used to be Rockwell. Rockwell was the company that was involved in the Apollo program, so they'd worked for the Russians way back then. They were knowledgeable with them. The Russians respected the Rockwell people. Bob Peercy and you'll see his name on the articles here, and he even presented those papers was one of the key members on my team, along with Miles Whitnah from NASA Headquarters, and then the rest of my group. Nancy Steisslinger is my backup co chairman, and she came along a little bit later in the program, has been very instrumental.\\n\\n The other has been the other strong working group chairmen. A lot of the other working groups, there was change in who headed those up. There was a lot of turnover, which bothered the Russians, by the way. They wanted more stable since it takes them a lot of working with somebody to get to know you, they get very upset if that changes very much, because then they don't know how to calibrate the next person. It bothers them more so than it would us, because we're more involved in change. Jim Nise is fortunate. He's been with the program since the very beginning. I've been with the program since the beginning, on my working group. I think just about all of the other working groups, however, have been through multiple changes in terms of who headed them up and so forth.\\n\\n The astronauts themselves, of course, were very instrumental in key people. Norm Thagard came back and provided a lot of insight. He was very vocal about things [that] [needed] to be fixed, and he caught some criticism about maybe griping, but from an engineering and programming sense, it was very good, because what we did is then worked on the things to improve on what Norm so all the follow on crews benefited a lot from Norm's feedback on what was happening.\\n\\n So Shannon Lucid's been a very key crewman. Some of the other crewmen who have flown have left and so forth. Shannon's still here. She's a valuable resource. She's still been the one that's been up there the longest.

We've learned a lot from them and all of us have improved a lot from them.\\n\\n I think, on the U.S. side, our crewmen tend to be a little bit more open and vocal about their experiences, more so than the Russian side, but I think that's been helpful, because even my Russian counterpart's indicated he's found out more in some respects the way the crew some of the things that really happened from what our crewmen have said, more so than what they get from their crewmen."

They had several changes, for example. When Nikita Khrushchev was there, he loosened things up a little bit. Then people would start to maybe talk to Westerners or something, and then [Leonid] Brezhnev came along and kind of clamped down on things. So those same people would often get arrested or taken away because, well, they spoke to a Westerner, for example, or they gave away too much information or got too friendly.\\n\\n So, because of those things, they were always very careful about what they said and they monitored their own people a lot. So if you're being monitored and recorded all the time, that can be a factor, too. So it's been tough for them to open up, if you want to call it that, like we would. So I think that was just part of their heritage and culture.\\n\\n I got invited to Star City for one of the cosmonaut debriefings, and there hasn't been many of us been involved who have been able to do that at Star City. I was surprised and this has been later that their cosmonauts were very open to their engineers about the problems and what needs to be fixed. They would say what things U.S. had that was better, and which things of the Russian stuff was better. They were very free about it. So I was surprised that they were pretty open in their debriefs, telling their engineering counterparts on the ground about the problems and so forth. They probably had a case where not as much of it got out into the press. On the other hand, they got exposed to that a lot during the missions, and because of that, a lot of them didn't even know how to deal with the press. So there was a lot of thinking they were misquoted or them not being very careful about what they said or so forth. That could cause some problems. So they've had a learning experience in that regard."

My counterpart can read English fairly good, speak it fair. So there's more of their understanding in that regard. Of course, that's been a help. At the same time, both sides have to be very careful about making sure and even on my case, where a few people know how to speak Russian that we make sure in our formal meetings that we speak through interpreters all the time so everybody hears the right thing. Our interpreters are trained to try to make things accurately translated and so forth. So in our important meetings, we always try to make sure we're talking each other languages and use the interpreter to make sure there's no miscommunication. That's been an ongoing thing.\\n\\n Even with that, because of differences in terminology and thinking, there's been times we've gone for a year I know even in our work, in the safety work, about a year later, \"Oh, that's what you mean!\" All of a sudden it would dawn on you. So there's always that chance of miscommunication, so you have to be very careful and go over things and make sure you understand and repeat back to them what you think your understanding is.

You take right now for the Space Station, we've only built the one node that we're processing. The Russians, on what they call the FGB, have seven FGBs they've built. They're used for various test models, but if you go look at them, they almost look identical to the flight hardware. In other words, they're not wooden mockups; they're actually built on the same assembly line as the other units.

The Soyuz vehicle they're using now has been modified, but it's basically the same vehicle they flew back in Apollo, for Apollo Soyuz.

And the changes that occur are usually to make something better rather than completely redesign. So that tends to reduce risk and they feel a lot better about the safety of the hardware and all.\\n\\n They are concerned about safety, they really are, and they were concerned about some of the things that we did in that regard. A lot of their concerns stem from our lack of testing. They've had a concern with the fact that we're not testing everything on our Space Station at the Cape like they would like to do. There's been big arguments about the fact that they do vacuum tests actually at the launch complex in their total hardware to make sure it's leak tight, doesn't leak. We didn't plan to do that in the program. Now we're rethinking some of that. So they've got a concern that we don't test and that we don't have a long history on some of our things because we've got some of this new stuff, whereas, like I said, we tend to rely on analysis and all of that more."

One thing, of course, that was important was, like I said, organizing your work, make sure you know how all your safety analysis is going to fit together, make sure you have a clear understanding of policy, and have a final goal and product in mind. Unfortunately, for our Space Station we don't have a well organized, integrated safety program like that, and the Russians are concerned about it. We were fortunate we were able to develop that, well laid out. The station program's been under way for a long period of time. It tends to have individual processes, but they're not well laid out and tied together like we have in the Phase One Program. So one lesson we can learn is to try to develop, simplify, and go to not many, a lot of different processes, but go to one that applies and try to make it streamlined and efficient so you don't get burdened down with all the paperwork, if you want to call it that, and make sure you're focused on the things that are really important.\\n\\n And even in the safety [area], making sure we could gain something by running more tests. They were more stringent on their tests. They were more stringent on their off gassing, and they off gas and test everything, whether it's toothpaste or lipstick or whatever, anything you take up there, because you're within a can. You're going to breathe whatever you take up there for a long period of time. You want to make sure it's all okay. So they're real stringent about that. So I think we've learned from them in that regard, that safety means more than analysis; it means making sure that we test everything and analyze everything very carefully before we put people up there to stay for a long period of time."

They were amazed when Rockwell, who is now Boeing North American, built an analytical model of this Russian docking mechanism.\\n\\n Later, when they had to do some off limit type testing, the Rockwell people ran their models, predicted what the results were, and the Russians were really surprised when they ran the tests, that the results matched very closely [to the] analytical results. So I think they've come to appreciate that, hey, there is some merit to this analytical modeling and analysis, computer things you can do.

So there was an acceptance at the beginning that we would accept each other's program in that regard, and then, like I said, when one was on each other's vehicle, they were responsible for safety. That's still true. Each one is still more responsible. But at the same time, we've learned to review each other's capabilities jointly together a lot better to make it even safer yet for each of them, for each group. They're more involved. They get more involved in what we're doing on the Shuttle. However, typically we were involving more of them in the beginning than they were vice versa, so I think more the change has been our involvement in Mir more so than Shuttle, because they were all fairly heavily involved.\\n\\n One of the complaints even our astronauts had was when their cosmonauts came over here, we tried to train them to actually be a crew member, operate the RMS arm or do something with the actual vehicle, rather than just be a passenger. One of the complaints we had from our early astronauts on the Mir was they were just a guest, you know. They really didn't get a chance to participate and maintain the Mir station or get training on this or that. That's changed now. Of course, we're now doing EVAs. Our guys are getting to go do an EVA in a Russian suit and operate their equipment, so now our astronauts are allowed to be more what you might, quote, a \"Mir crew member,\" rather than just being a guest on board their ship and all."

        "utterance": "Well, first off, of course, we were concerned because we felt like the people had a lot of wrong information. There was a little lack of understanding of the way with the Mir station being up there for a long duration, it wasn't going to fall out of the sky right away. The other thing about safety was, they always had like an ambulance or escape vehicle right there. Okay? And like the Russians kept pointing out, they said, \"You don't have an escape vehicle on the Shuttle. If you have a problem, that's that.\" So their point was, even though these problems were what we'd call safety problems, they didn't feel it was a safety problem for the crew because the crew could go get in the Soyuz and come home if it got bad, really bad, up there. It's not like they were going to be stuck, to die right there. So a lot of our activity became trying to explain to them and show to the outside groups what our safety process was and so forth.\\n\\n I think, in retrospect, I'll have to say this. I think they made us better, you know. We had to go through things a little bit more rigorously and so forth. For example, this criteria we came up with, that was a fallout of a lot of this concern about the safety. We didn't have a formalized criteria, and that was a good thing probably to do. So I think we improved our overall program with that outside critiquing.\\n\\n At the same time, I felt very good in a sense that after providing all this information going back from the beginning, and the people going through it, we never got any complaints that our safety program had holes in it or wasn't sufficient. The only thing they wanted us to do was was for us to do more. For example, like I pointed out to you, once we separated and we were separate, we didn't have this formal analysis; each country was responsible. And they saw that in our policy documents, so it wasn't a complaint that we weren't doing what we should be doing. They recognized we were doing everything we should be doing. As a matter of fact, they indicated the program was very good. Their point was that, \"Well, wait a minute. Since we still have an astronaut in there, you ought to be doing the same formal analysis while the Shuttle's gone.\" So that led to us making this change in our policy. So it was more or less what you were doing wasn't a problem, it's just that we want you to do more than what you were doing.\\n\\n So as a result of all those reviews, we've expanded the scope of our safety analysis and joint work. But it created a lot of work on us. We had to go back through and provide a lot of records, go through a lot of data. The way it was handled, it was upsetting to some people. I've talked to the IG [Inspector General] Office about that, because typically in the government, when the IG's called in, it's like a criminal investigation, so people get scared. Do I have to have a lawyer? And congressional groups actually have two outside groups: the IG and then they have the GAO [Government Accounting Office] that goes in and does audits. So my understanding at the time was, I didn't know why Sensenbrenner didn't choose if this truly was an audit of our process and safety, in my mind, the right thing to have done was dealing with the GAO and done that, because they're familiar with doing those audits.\\n\\n Well, it turns out the IG Office does do these other type of audits. When I was talking to the head IG person about that, she admitted that one of the lessons learned was they didn't make it clear to a lot of people when they came in here that, \"Hey, we're not doing this criminal audit type thing that you recognize us for; we're doing an audit function from analysis or similar to what the GAO does, provide a report.\" If they'd done that, I think that would have helped alleviate a lot of people's concerns and so forth."

        "utterance": "In terms of Space Station, I think it's been a big help for learning to we're going to have other countries up there to live and work together. There's been a lot of things due to the problems that have occurred on Mir, that have made us rethink, \"You know, gee, maybe we'd better get serious about \" For example, we in the safety world were starting to have problems on station. People are often wanting to run cables through hatches and a bunch of things, rather than design a way around it, because it's more difficult or more expensive to do that. But when we had the collision and the depressurization, all of a sudden people saw, hey, there is a need to maybe suddenly be able to shut that hatch quickly and help yourself out. So those sort of problems have provided a lot of focus, from a safety standpoint, on the things we really need to look after and do for the International Space Station.\\n\\n I think we've been rethinking our testing. I know for a fact we've been doing some additional testing we originally didn't plan to do on our hardware, based on the Russians' concerns and what they're doing.\\n\\n I think it's helped the general public out in the science that we're getting back. It may not be visible right away, but a lot of the life science that was being conducted on cells and calcium loss and all that should hopefully benefit others. And I think it's brought the two countries closer together \"We're in this together\" type thing. It should help us a lot when we go dealing and working with the Japanese and the Europeans later for the International Station. It's also allowed us to work with somebody where somebody else is just as knowledgeable on operating in space as we are. Some of the countries accuse us of thinking we're the best and know how to do it all and not willing to accept. I think the Russians have taught us that, hey, there's other ideas out there besides ours. And I think that's been good.\\n\\n I think it's been a lot more information to the public about space and what's going on, not only the risks, but there's been a lot more exposure on television and so forth about the work that's being done. So I think overall it's going to be very useful."

        "utterance": "That concept. The working group concept. The other thing it might be good for you to talk to is some of the TTI people that are interpreters, particularly in the area of what they feel has worked and hasn't worked. I've gotten feedback from them that there is some working groups that haven't worked nearly as smoothly. I may have kind of a false impression, because I've heard, now, and one would have go to independently. I'm not trying to brag too much here, but at the same time I've gotten feedback that our group seems to work very well together and so forth. So it might be desirable. Now, I've heard some groups, there tended to be more of this, \"Well, you've got to do it our way.\" Of course, if you go in that way, that creates a problem.\\n\\n The other factor might be and I think it is important is the fact that I've been the same person working with them, going back to this. I also invite them to my house. We try to socialize. We took them places. In other words, when the day ended, we didn't go our separate ways and that was it; we actually made an effort to go take them shopping, to go take them somewhere. Of course, we did it with our own money, but we did that so we'd learn to understand each other better socially. Because we had heard and rightly so that that's part of their culture. So that's made us much closer, working together and so forth.\\n\\n But TTI would give you probably some good feel for even lessons learned about what works with working because, see, they work with multiple groups. They get to see a lot of different groups, on what works and doesn't work. Like I said, one lesson learned is that you would think if you had somebody on your team that spoke Russian real well, that it would be a help in the conversation, but we found out that if that individual's talking to my Russian counterpart in Russian, I don't know what they're saying and what's going on, and you're not sure that things are being done right. So we make a rule right away that even if you can talk English and the Russians understand that themselves, even though they can speak English very well, some of them, they make sure that in informal meetings they always talk through an interpreter, except for social. So it's very important. Like I said, that's been one of the biggest things that created a lot of problems in the beginning, is this misunderstanding. You thought you knew what they were saying or you thought you understood what it was, and then you found out later that, no, that wasn't right, etc. So it took a long period of time to really get things understood, and also for us to recognize we've really got to concentrate on that and make sure each other understands, because if you don't, you're going down a wrong path."

The other things I don't think we got a lot out of. Two reasons. Most of the people that worked on that program weren't working on Phase One. There was only a few of us that worked back then, so there wasn't really a lot of carryover, if you want to call it that. The other was that there wasn't this real long term many missions' worth of work, so you didn't have a chance to go and there was not this openness, as much sharing of information and so forth.\\n\\n So even in my case, I don't think there was I think the biggest carryover was the working group concept, the management concept, and knowing a little bit about the culture. That is, that you had to get to know each other and make sure you trusted each other and work together before something was really going to work, or before they would tell you things, and vice versa. And, of course, the importance of having interpreters. But beyond that, at least from my perspective, I don't think we had a lot then. Also, even back then there wasn't a separate safety working group. I think a big plus in the Phase One Program is we had a focused safety working group. Of course, the need for that wasn't quite as great during Apollo Soyuz. It was one mission. There was just a short time together and all. There was some analysis done, but it wasn't in a separate group and focused nearly as much as what we did here. So we didn't learn much about each other's safety program back then because there wasn't that much dealing and working together."

But we didn't have laid out a structured process that was very clear on who did what, how it fit together, and how it related at the end. We were thinking about, more or less, one safety analysis document. Of course, like I said, the thing we brought to the table is this formal safety analysis. It was more or less like we'll have this one document and we'll go have others review it and so forth, whereas they said, \"Let's first have policy. Let's have requirements. Let's see how we meet each other's requirements, then how many documents we're given.\" It was a big help to us because I think other working groups struggled a little bit with their documentation. So we both brought our ideas together, but I recognized, and some of my people I wasn't the only one, and we all worked together we recognized that, hey, that really makes a lot of sense. I said, \"Great. Let's do this.\" Of course, that made their acceptance of our ideas very good, too, the fact that we were willing to accept their concept and go forward with it.\\n\\n In all fairness, in those early meetings there was a lot more arguing of each other's cases, you know. There was a lot more kind of setting each other's boundary conditions and so forth. And we didn't have quite that much understanding and trust yet, see. So later, you know, now there's very little of that. Still we'll make a strong case or something, but it doesn't take us long to reach agreement and so forth now, because we really do think a lot alike."

You take, for example, in the science group, oddly enough, in the very beginning it was Dr. Carolyn Huntoon, who was later Center director, and then it was, I think, her deputy, John Rummell, that took over. Then it was Dr. Peggy Whitson who now then got selected for the Astronaut Office, so she got replaced by another lady doctor, and unfortunately I can't remember her name just offhand. Presently it's John Uri. So there's like six or seven changes. And yet on their side, it was always working with Dr. Lebedev."

Steve Nagel, who used to work in our office, was an astronaut, and he served in one of those, and he said he could see that was very traumatic on his Russian counterpart that he worked with. He'd worked with him for six months and they got to know each other fairly well, and then he cycled out and someone else stepped in. So most of the other groups have had changes like that.\\n\\n Fortunately, when it comes to program managers, we've been very stable in that regard. Tommy was there, but then Frank came on fairly soon as his deputy, and so there wasn't that much of a transition when Tommy left."

We’ve come here today—I’ve come here with my colleague Hunter Hollins, who’s the loan manager—to look at a Shuttle EMU [extravehicular mobility unit], which is one part of the collection that we don’t have. We have very little from the Shuttle International Space [Station, ISS] Program era. Just by virtue of the components being reusable, the economy of the Shuttle Program and the International Space Station Program, they’ve changed much in the way that property has been disposed of.\\n\\n The Air and Space Museum has had an agreement with NASA since the late 1960s of right of first refusal for historic artifacts. We preserve them, try our best to stop them at that point in time when they come into our collection. For that reason we haven’t gotten very many objects from the Shuttle or ISS Program.\\n\\n Having something like a full EMU would vastly increase the scope of our collection, and give us the possibility of telling the story of the Shuttle and the ISS and its construction to our public in ways they can understand. Spacesuits really are the charismatic objects of our collection because even small children can understand how they work and function on a general basis. They can look at them and say oh, you need this, these are clothes that you need to wear to work out in space. They understand that, so that’s what we’re here for."

We’re trying to move out of there, but we still have some operations there. We’ve opened up a new storage facility for our collection at the [Steven F. Udvar-]Hazy Center. It’s at the southeast point of [Washington] Dulles [International] Airport, easily accessible from the airport. We’ve opened up a new storage facility in the last year which will house our artifacts that are not on display.\\n\\n When the spacesuit comes to us, it will go initially to the [Paul E.] Garber [Preservation, Restoration, and Storage] Facility, where our collections people will unpack it and examine it, document its condition. This is a much longer process than most people think. We like to make sure that we know exactly what we have and precisely what condition it is in.\\n\\n Then our staff conservator, who’s a specialist in spacesuits and spacesuit materials, Lisa Young, will take a look at it. We will work together to try to figure out what sort of support structure we’ll need to construct to go inside the suit. Just having it on display as is used for public affairs is one thing, but when we’re considering long term stabilization of the suit—all of our suits have what we refer to as mannequins but they’re not really mannequins. They’re structural supports built on the inside of suits that with conservationally correct materials will help the suits withstand gravity and any sort of the trials of being on display for a long period of time.\\n\\n From there it will likely go from Garber in Suitland to the Hazy Center because the conservation lab will soon be located at the Hazy Center, and we’ll work on it there. Instead of being on display near Discovery at the Hazy Center it will be on display in a new gallery that we’re hoping to finally open this summer, Moving Beyond Earth, which tells the story of the Shuttle and the International Space Station construction. It’s a gallery that will draw some of our 8 million to 10 million visitors every year to the National Mall museum.\\n\\n So it’ll be a slow progress over about a 50-mile radius over a period of time. We’ll have checkout, fitting for conservation correctness, preparation for display. Then our designers will come in and take measurements to make sure everything fits, that the lighting is appropriate for the suit. What we’ve found with our suit collection is that lighting gives the greatest potential damage to the suits, and that damage is cumulative, so we’re taking extra care to make sure that the light exposure is very very limited.\\n\\n In this new gallery that will be the case, so it’ll take a long course, much longer than many people would consider. It doesn’t just arrive happily in place on display. There are a lot of people who have their hands—my colleagues in collections, design, conservation will all play their part."

The suits were custom-made for each astronaut, so we have an idea. We know about the fitting process, the sewing process, working with the soft goods, and the transport between ILC [Dover, LP in Delaware] and Hamilton Standard and then down to [NASA] Kennedy Space Center [Florida]. That process was very standardized.\\n\\n With the EMU it’s much different because the suit that we’re looking at has components with different histories and different uses, so we will have to do research on each individual component. That’ll take time and effort. That’s what I’m paid to do, trying to gather as much information as possible. Not only about the construction but about the procedures, if components were flown, when their launch date was, whether they were on the Shuttle, whether they were on the International Space Station, what they were used for, when they were returned to Earth, what other work they’ve done. Just trying to document every single aspect of the history of each component. Flight history, postflight history, and going on from there. Not only through logbooks and records, but also through photography, see if we can find situational photography showing components in action while on the Space Station.\\n\\n Gathering as much as possible, overburdening our servers with as much information as possible, but trying to preserve as much information. Oftentimes we’ve found a lot of this information gets lost over the years. That’s one of the problems that I have finding information on the Apollo Program. At the time when the Apollo Program wound down, much of that documentation was lost because corporations don’t like to hold on to documents. They have lawyers who insist that they don’t need to. Only the things that go through the records schedule for the National Archives [and Records Administration] get preserved at Fort Worth [Texas]. We’re often looking for those personal stories that if we don’t capture them right at the moment, they go uncaptured. People retire, people forget. They take their personal files with them, or they don’t take them at all and they get shoved aside when the office is moved and things get lost.\\n\\n What I try to do is get as much of that documentation information—including the little notes and notebooks that engineers have had and technicians have had over the years—just to precisely be able to say this is what this piece did. This is its history from the time that it was on the cutting boards in Dover [Delaware] to the time it came to us. We can tell the history of each component, that’s the ideal. Don’t often get to that ideal, but that’s our ideal."

But we have prototypes, we have test suits, training suits—suits that were never meant to fly but were contract suits. We have four of the contract suits that were submitted for the initial request for proposals through NASA for the Apollo program. These are suits that were manufactured by companies that people no longer assume have anything to do with the space program, but were involved in the space program, or interested in working on the Apollo Program back in the 1960s.\\n\\n We have engineering model suits that are asymmetrical, that are designed to test different options on joints. They tell a lot about the history of developing joints and the limitations of engineering a suit so an astronaut can actually do productive work in space. We also have hard suits that date back from the 1950s, the Litton [Industries] vacuum chamber suits that they produced while they were working under contract with the Air Force.\\n\\n The Air Force continued that program, and when they turned it over to NASA they turned into the RX series of suits, and went on to the AX series that [NASA] Ames [Research Center, Moffett Field, California] worked on as well. We have this large spread of hard suits, and they’re very useful to explain to our public how they came about—how they were really the first suits to be designed to work in a vacuum, and after NASA went through soft suits like the Apollo suits, they’ve come back to the hard suit idea yet again after years; and the difficulties of combining both launch and entry suit function with EVA [extravehicular activity] function, and how that works, and how that split off again.\\n\\n We also have early flight suits that NASA was testing at the Marshall Space Flight Center [Huntsville, Alabama]. We have very rare suits, for example an Arrowhead Mark IV that Arrowhead Company had submitted to the Navy as a flight suit. The Navy pilots really really hated it, because it had a corrugated torso and legs for flexibility. They found it very uncomfortable. The remarkable thing is that for some reason [Marshall Center Director] Wernher von Braun loved that suit and there are photos of him walking around in it. Interesting enough, it was that convolute technology that ILC had proposed that caught NASA’s eye and got them the contract in part. So you have suits that show technologies over the years and how they’ve come.\\n\\n We also have a diving suit from the Navy from the beginning of the last century. It’s not in my collection, but we have one of Wiley [H.] Post’s suits [first pilot to fly solo around the world] that he designed with Russell Colley [Mercury spacesuit designer] to build that first flight suit in order to go higher and faster. The range of suits is amazing.\\n\\n We also have little known suits from the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program, which really are the only pieces of hardware from that program that have survived, the Defense Department’s program. Those suits give us a clue about the intentions and what that program was going to be. They have gloves that have sharkskin applied to the palms of the hands, and also have stainless steel fingernails on the exterior of the gloves. What we understand from what the plans were, they needed to give the pilots from that program extra manual dexterity so they could turn dials and have fine motor control, which they wouldn’t normally have at that level of glove technology.\\n\\n I could talk on about any one of them, but we have a range of suits. Not just the lunar suits, but a lot of things in between."

Oftentimes we receive suits from NASA that have had the cover layers removed.

But that too tells us a history. I’m very optimistic about showing that to the public just to say look, the suits don’t stop working when they come back to Earth. That’s when a lot of the learning begins, in how it performs. That tells a story as well. We have those components, and those are all out in our new storage facility now."

        "utterance": "There’s a saying among conservators—and plastic conservation is having this great surge right now. People are looking at plastics and synthetics from the point of view of art that was done about that time, and including the suits. Plastics have a half-life of 50 years, so if we’re looking at our collection, by and large it’s hit its half-life. Plastics aren’t forever. They deteriorate, as everybody knows. Your vinyl lawn chairs will eventually turn yellow and brittle and start falling apart. The problem that we have preserving the suits is that they’re combined materials, and some of them don’t react very well together.\\n\\n In the strictly conservation sense, the one thing to do to assure preservation of all the components would be to take them apart. Well we can’t do that, so we have to find a way to preserve them best when they’re together and combined, and to isolate components that are cross-reacting. My colleague Lisa Young, who’s a conservator, has done quite a lot of work on trying to find the optimal situation. As I mentioned light is limited, humidity is limited, temperature is limited.\\n\\n We used to think that very cold storage worked. That didn’t work, that actually accelerated some of the cross-linking in the plastics. We’ve settled on 60 degrees Fahrenheit and held to under 35 percent humidity, which is quite a relief. We always used to joke that the suits came from Dover, Delaware to Houston to Kennedy, and then went to Washington. We’re talking about the most humid places you can get in terms of heat and humidity, but we’re trying to ameliorate some of that.\\n\\n There have been occasions where we’ve had to remove components of the suits. The polyvinyl chloride is a material that we just can’t seem to stabilize. In order to preserve the rest of the suit we’ve removed some hoses on some occasions. [Alan L.] Bean’s suit is one case in point that there was nothing we could do to stabilize it, so taking the hose, taking a minor part off the suit in order to preserve the greater suit is one way to do it.\\n\\n At this point we know that’s stabilizing it, and we’re always looking for the next thing. There’s certain suggestions that have come up over the years that may not be feasible. Storing them in an inert gas—oxidation isn’t the major problem we’re having, and storing any object, especially a large object, in an inert chamber has other problems: access, expense. Whether that cost outweighs the benefit over time is something we’re looking into.\\n\\n But we keep trying. Lisa is constantly talking to materials scientists, plastics experts, and also materials engineers, the people who built it, trying to get the details. That’s one of the sides of the details that I’m looking for when I collect an object, trying to find as much information about how the soft goods were made and produced. Because sometimes things change. People forget over time, and it doesn’t absolutely get documented. If we get it right at the time we don’t have to go back and find that after 1975 they started adding another additive, and the plastics were lasting longer. We have to look and see what that additive does to the rest of the suit."

It began really with my predecessor, Amanda Young, who back in 1999 applied to the Save America’s Treasures project, which was a millennial project from the White House [White House Millennium Council]. I think Hillary [R.] Clinton as first lady was the major sponsor of it through the [National] Park Service. She applied for a grant and got matching funds from Hamilton Sundstrand to examine the components of the Apollo suits and determine why they were aging so badly.\\n\\n We had had the suits since the 1970s and we had many suits out on loan. About a third of our collection is out on loan. They were coming back in very bad shape, not as a result of abuse but as a result of aging. The beta cloth was deteriorating, the badges were gone. You could feel that the suits were becoming brittle on the inside.\\n\\n She got the grant and she was able to convene working groups on materials, to gather some of the technicians and engineers who had worked on it so they could brainstorm and remember exactly what happened, what their intention was in the beginning. When you’re making a suit with a 6-month working life expectancy, you’re not necessarily motivated to make it so it can be preserved for 50 to 100 years, but that information is necessary so we could learn what these materials are.\\n\\n She worked with Lisa Young at the time to develop an ideal situation. Suits were made to work in zero-g [gravity] or the one-sixth gravity on the surface of the Moon. They were collapsing on themselves and we had to design supports. Lisa and Amanda worked together to design supports that would not interact with any of the suit components but would stabilize the physical shape of the suits.\\n\\n In working together they put together a booklet that Hunter, my colleague, has on the care of the national collection of spacesuits. It’s The Preservation, Storage and Display of Spacesuits. That was the product of their research, and it focused on specific materials. They couldn’t do everything, but it got a lot of the information in stabilization, especially in the problem areas: the convolutes, the zippers. Brass and rubber don’t like each other. Over a long term they start to attack one another, and we were finding the zippers didn’t work anymore. They were either frozen open or frozen closed. We had to look into what we could do to solve that problem, and what we could do to stabilize it. Stabilization is the key.\\n\\n Reversing the problem is longer term, and we still haven’t come up with any ideas. But stabilizing it for as long as we can, slowing the deterioration until we get to the next step. It’s an iterative process. They’re getting stabilized, and now we’re starting to find other ways. Maybe we can do something. Maybe we can do testing, find other ways to work with objects."

Apollo 11, all the astronauts left their personal life support systems on the surface of the Moon, and all but Cernan and [Harrison H. “Jack”] Schmitt left their overshoes on the surface.\\n\\n We put together as much as possible in a full-up assembly, and we found one of the contributing factors to the deterioration of the interior of the suit—by doing that we were closing up the suit entirely and causing a microenvironment to form inside the suit. You have not a constant airflow, and humidity and everything else would build up, especially off gassing of materials. So we no longer display our suits that way. You’ll never see an Apollo suit all as one thing. We separate the helmet, the gloves.\\n\\n The zippers are always open by virtue of that and also virtue of display constraints. In order to create a structure that would support the weight of that suit, we have to find a way to insert a steel armature on the inside that will support the weight. That is padded with padding-support material, conservation-correct material. Those are the major learning things. Keeping temperature low, humidity low, monitoring for light.\\n\\n If anyone’s ever been to the museum, we have lots of ceiling windows, and we have tried to limit the light. We’ve taken the suits out of open galleries with lots of visible light as well as UV [ultraviolet] light. Visible light is as dangerous to the materials as UV, and we’re putting them into closed galleries with limited light."

That didn’t happen to all the suits, and we’ve been able to retrieve the chemical process that was used on those suits at the time.\\n\\n What we do now, our focus is to stabilize the suits at the point when we receive them. Cleaning is limited. It has to be reversible, and it can’t damage the components of the suit. So we clean with ethanol and usually just a light vacuum with a HEPA [high-efficiency particulate air] filter to try to get surface debris and dust. Lunar regolith doesn’t come off, and we’re very glad about that because that’s led to later research. Just to get the surface contaminants that got attached to the suit as the result of transport or everyday use post their mission life. Basic cleaning, but nothing harsh or abrasive. Nothing that’s irreversible, nothing that will take away from the working history of the suit."

He wanted to know if he could try X-raying a suit to see what’s inside. We also tried CAT [computed axial tomography] scanning, but unfortunately the CAT scanner that the Smithsonian has is very limited in size. We could only do a glove or boot, but you can begin to see how the interior structure, the structure you couldn’t see between the pressure layer and the cover layer, was deteriorating and deforming.\\n\\n The X-rays gave us that added information because using the old wet check technique of X-ray, Ron [Roland H.] Cunningham could lay out the suit, lay out all his plates, and go from plate to plate. Then our photographer could knit all the components together into one big X-ray so you could see all the infrastructure inside the suit. You could tell if there was any deformity. You could also see the structure inside the suit that nobody sees, that people are often surprised to see. There are wiring and electrodes that go down through the entire suit, to give them a sense of it’s not just restraint layer, but also you have electricity going through. You’ve got everything going through and operating, and how really complex these machines are to preserve life in space."

In 1996 we were planning to redo our Space Hall gallery, and it just so happened that came a couple of years after the Russians began selling off some of their space hardware at auction. [H.] Ross Perot purchased many samples of Soviet hardware, and there were several other collectors as well and he offered it to us. At the time we thought well, this is a fantastic opportunity. We can pair Russian and American components and show the difference between the two sides’ approach to the technologies, especially during the Cold War when there wasn’t a lot of communication between the two sides. They were taking very different routes for the same objective.\\n\\n It just so happened that at that time when we were preparing the gallery, that was the beginning of the Shuttle-Mir [Russian space station] Program. Norman [E.] Thagard had returned. He had gone up on a Soyuz [Russian space vehicle] and he came back down on a Shuttle. So that meant, importantly for me, that he brought his suit back with him. His suit landed in the United States and didn’t go back to Russia, where they traditionally take them apart.\\n\\n NASA offered and we accepted to transfer that suit, that so-called launch and entry suit. The Russians refer to it as an emergency suit. It came into our collection, then several years later Dennis [A.] Tito, who was the first space tourist—though he prefers to be the “first privately-funded space traveler,” which is much more difficult to say than “space tourist”—went back to [NPP] Zvezda [Russian aeronautical and space manufacturer] and purchased his suit after his flight and in turn donated it to the museum.\\n\\n So now in a very odd situation we have the world’s foremost collection of American spacesuits, but we have no launch and entry suits from the Shuttle and International Space Station Program, but we have two Russian suits from that vintage. We’re hoping to collect more in that area, just documenting it. By virtue of the way the Russians build their suits, test them and recycle the components, there are things that become available on eBay [online auction site], but getting them directly from them with a documented history is much more difficult."

It’s a very neat technology, and it also explains a lot. At the time Americans weren’t working on it because they weren’t doing long term spaceflight, but it’s a very important technology.

        "utterance": "As I said, the Garber Facility at Suitland is a very old facility. It was squared away largely by Paul E. Garber, who was our first curator of the National Air Museum. He managed to get Quonset huts and temporary buildings built. It’s adjacent to property that the Smithsonian also owned, and it was able to use that for storage. Having a collection such as ours, we have 60,000 objects today ranging in size from the Saturn Vs [rockets] that are around the country on loan, to we have media bowls that were used to grow cells and tissue culture. We’ve been storing things at the Garber facility under not ideal circumstances, not climate-controlled. The advantage and the purpose of building the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center was to build a state-of-the-art storage facility where we can have absolute climate control. We were able to design the facility to fit our collection, which is a wonderful opportunity.\\n\\n We had designed a spacesuit room, “my room” as I like to call it, and it’s actually reserved for rubbers and flight suits. We designed it to fit the size of the collection, the scope of the collection, and to fit those rigid requirements for temperature and humidity control. It’s very controlled access. Even I don’t have access. Our collections people guard it very seriously, and it’s actually a room inside a room. The outer room houses fur and leather collections that had previously not been stored under optimal circumstances, all with an eye to preserve them for another generation.\\n\\n We’ve initiated the move from the Garber Facility, moving slowly. The spacesuits were first. We’ll be moving fur and leather next, and then small objects. I think the move is now scheduled over the course of five to seven years, depending on funding and resources. We’ve had to hire a number of contractors who have developed expertise in handling objects, packaging objects, finding a way to package objects so they can have the minimal handling. You can have a tray for a glove that will pack nicely and stack inside a larger container, so you can transport that to the new facility and then pull it out, remove the packing, and put the glove in its final storage position without touching the glove. That takes a lot of knowledge and technique and understanding of the fragility of the glove and how you prepare the glove for storage.\\n\\n The Garber Facility eventually, once we vacate it—that’s going to be a very long time, five to seven years just to move the small and medium objects only. We still have airplane fuselages that we don’t have the space for. We outgrew our space while we were planning for it. As we turn over the buildings, the Smithsonian is hoping to build new expanded improved storage buildings in the area on the premises. It’s going to take some time, but we’ll eventually get there. If we can build some larger facilities on the Hazy grounds that’ll hold the fuselages, we’ll be able to do it."

        "utterance": "It’s a very elaborate move. Going from Suitland, Maryland to Hazy, that’s about 40 miles. But you have to take into consideration traffic. We have several trucks, one tractor trailer semi. In order to get from Suitland to Hazy there’s only one time you can do it, and that’s before dawn. Even then the traffic is horrendous. Our truck driver who’s been doing this for years moved the aircraft from Garber to Hazy. He assured me, “Cathy, if you get on the road by 6:00 a.m. you’ll be fine.”\\n\\n The first time I did it following the truck, I said, “But Doug, I went on the road at 6:00. Where did all these people come from?” I couldn’t believe that there were all these people on the road. We have the worst traffic in the country in the DC area, so got to be on the road at 6:00 a.m., and not a chance of making it in 45 minutes. You have to wait out the traffic. Everything is prepared for storage, packed, and then stacked in the tractor trailer the night before. Take the truck out, unload the truck, put everything away, and then prepare for the next time. It took us about two months. One day packing, one day unpacking, and we moved 175 suits in that time.\\n\\n One of the really—what I think—cooler aspects is trying to figure out how we box the suits. The suits were not in crates in storage, we came up with the idea. I think it was Hunter’s idea to use the containers that the coffin companies use to transport coffins. They’re rugged enough to be able to withstand the weight of the suit, and they’re also wide enough to hold our largest suits and some of the hard suits, have a 38-inch width at the shoulder. We could retrofit them with conservation-correct materials and strap them down, so we had 13 coffin boxes every other day going out. But everything was protected. It went really really well, it’s a great bunch of guys."

        "utterance": "It’s a twofold effort. On one hand the Air and Space Museum has an agreement with NASA. We get right of first refusal on hardware when you’re through with it on programmatic use, and we also stipulate that if there’s ever any call for NASA to look back at objects they’re always welcome. And we will give things back. We worked that way with the [OV-101] Enterprise. We lent back the leading edges of the wings, the landing gear.\\n\\n We’ve had a number of groups of engineers from JSC, from the various contractors, come in and look at our suit collection, just as a way of training the next generation to see what’s been tried in the past. That’s always very important, because there are no textbooks on suit development. People tend to forget. They see the finished product but they don’t remember oh, we tried this, this, this and this, and we finally decided that this is the only way given these limitations that you can work out a shoulder joint in these confined spaces. So we work in that way.\\n\\n On the other hand there’s the public aspect, which is really fascinating because the museum routinely has family days when they bring in demonstrations. ILC comes out and brings parts of gloves and other suit components. Recently we had people from [NASA] Goddard [Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland] working on the Hubble Space Telescope repair who had tools and equipment that was used in the Hubble Space Telescope.\\n\\n There’s just nothing as wonderful as seeing a kids’ eyes light up when they realize that they have their hand in that glove, that thick bulky glove, that has all these layers for a reason. You can explain to them what each layer does, and they have to be able to hold this tool and operate this tool. What amazing amount of engineering and science goes into that, explains that. That’s generating the newer generation. Not just the new generation of engineers and technicians, but the newer generation of kids who understand that—as I said, these are really complex machines. They work a purpose, and they took a lot of time and energy. Just as there are many layers of the suit, there are many layers of the work that goes into that. Kids are always very fascinated.\\n\\n As I said, the suits are very charismatic objects. They’re very personal. Children understand, everyone understands them at some level of what they have to do to function. Showing them the inside out, explaining the layers—really it’s a wonderful feeling when you see that light up—“Oh, to be able to do that... How can you grip that? Why do you make these tools with these huge knobs?”—it makes sense. That thought process is wonderful."

[I remember] one occasion a barnstormer landed an airplane [in a field] very close to the little town where I lived, and my dad happened to have me in the car [with him] when he'd been to see his mother, which was a few miles out of town and [close to where his mother lived.

        "utterance": "Well, that is another…interesting story. At the age of about fourteen…[I lived] in the little town of Wadesboro, North Carolina…[where I was born and raised. The] population [was] about 5,500, and they had a little airport, and the fellow [Charles Brigman] that ran that airport [also] built model airplanes… I just was so interested…[in the models that] I got the courage to ask him, to see his model airplanes.\\n\\n Then [later] I was hired [by him] as what I would call an airport flunky. I cut grass, I pumped gas, I cleaned airplanes, and everything…[that needed to be done. He paid me $5 a week.] A dollar a week…I used for Coca-Colas and moon pies, or later we had Pepsi-Colas and then a Bracer [drink], which was [made by] a local manufacturer, [it] was sort of like a Pepsi. The rest of it I would spend on…flying [time] in the airplane.\\n\\n Then many of the pilots would take me up if they were just flying. They would take me up and let me fly. So I learned to fly that way [also], and I soloed in 1941. I was the typical [young teenage boy]—I was afraid of [what] my mother and dad [would say], because they didn't know that I [was learning] flying. I finally had to get a medical [to solo], so my dad was such a strict disciplinarian that I went to my mother and enticed her into letting me go to Charlotte [North Carolina] and getting a medical… And I did. I had a total of an hour and thirty-two minutes legal time and I soloed, but I had [also] ridden a lot of times [with other pilots who let me fly besides my instructor]. I still have that log book.\\n\\n From that point, I [continued to fly], and then in 1943—and I brought with me for verification of it—I was [told that I was] the youngest flight instructor in the military, as a civilian, and that was [after] I [had] just turned eighteen. You're supposed to be twenty-one…[After my civilian check ride] I had to take a check ride with a [Air Force] major, and he asked me, after we'd gotten down… how old I was, and then I didn't even think, I just said, \"Eighteen\" without even thinking about what [I said], and I had put down that I was twenty-one. He said, \"Come to my office immediately,\" so I went to his office, and he said, \"You flew very satisfactorily, and I'm going to go to Maxwell Field [Montgomery, Alabama] and see if I can get a waiver for you to instruct.\"\\n\\n So he did do that, and I did get a waiver, and I was the youngest civilian flight instructor in the first phase of teaching the military pilots. It was called a civilian pilot training school, and they had Stearmans. That's how [the] beginning of my aviation career started. So I do have the piece of paper that he signed here where I [received] my instructor's rating in 1943."

They had other [primary Army Air Force] flying schools… [The company] later became Southern Airways, and then…[finally] were bought out and they became part of another airline. But I was hired [when they were Georgia Air Service].\\n\\n And then what they did, I'd had a little bit of a funnies with my medical situation then, which I'll tell you about. But the situation was, is that they had such a demand for flight instructors that they sent us to a military facility. I went to an Army military facility and got a medical, and then I was put on the reserve status, enlisted reserve status. So I couldn't be physically drafted while I was instructing, as long as I was instructing. So I did that. I instructed.\\n\\n Then when the war was sort of winding down, they called me on active duty. At that point in time, there was a medical test that they called a Snyder, which was a German medical-type test, where you lie down for three minutes and then they get you up and you exercise for so much and run your pulse rate up to a certain thing. Then you lie back down again, and they take it like every minute. They have a scale. In my case, my normal pulse rate is about 80, where the normal is 72. That's an hereditary thing, nothing wrong, but it's just high. So I couldn't pass it to go in as an active pilot, but they changed that because I had been an instructor. So I did go in and I did not go through all of the normal flight training, but I did get a commission. So, after that, I got in and I was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Force, and I flew B-25s.\\n\\n After all of that training and all of the instructing, I was sent back because of my experience to be a part of a standardization board, and I flew check rides on students and pilots. So I didn't actually go overseas. It was a benefit to me, although everybody—I'm glad that I didn't, but I was sorry that I didn't. But they did, for the one time, the government did the right thing; they took a person that had the experience to do the job, and I had the experience. I had the experience in instructing, and I had the experience in riding check rides, so it was a good choice. That was located at Bennitsville, South Carolina, called Georgia Air Service at the time.\\n\\n One of the fellows from down here at the Johnson Space Center [Houston, Texas] that has the aviator shop up here, went back to Bennitsville, South Carolina, recently and took pictures of all of the facilities that has now changed, and it's a local airport, but it was in the lobby, and he took pictures and made copies for me. So I now have pictures showing it like when I was there. He went through there as a student while I was an instructor."

When I got out after basically the war was over, I was able to get out, and I kept reserve commission, but I did get out and I went flying for an outfit and working with then the little town of Wadesboro, with Wadesboro Ice and Fuel Company, and they also ran W&L Airways, which was a little fixed-base operation, instruction and charter and things of that nature. So I'd work half the time as that, and part of the time I worked—they had an A&P mechanic that I'd known in Georgia Air Service, and we bought a Stearman together, a surplus Stearman, together, and I was flying air shows with it and instructing in it, and then he maintained it, and then I was teaching him how to fly. So we ended up having the Stearman there at the same time, so we stayed there and flew. I stayed there and flew for about seventeen or eighteen months. I don't remember exactly.\\n\\n But after that, we had a student that I had taught and soloed in the first Ercoupe, which is a low-wing, supposed to have been a safe airplane, where with ailerons and the rudders were linked together and it was supposed to be able to fly it like a car or drive it and fly. I let him go over town on Mother's Day. He had flown enough that he was okay. It was about three miles. He wanted to go, and he went over and, amazingly enough, and it never crossed my mind, he buzzed his house and pulled the power back, and his mother and dad were out there, and he flew through the power lines and was killed. It happened that my brother—my mother's home was very close to there—got to him first, and he might have been alive, but before my brother could get to him, it all burst into flames, so he was burned.\\n\\n So after that, then they shut down that airport, and then I turned around and decided that I needed to go to college, which is what I did. I went back and got an engineering degree. So that's sort of the history of the flying."

I wanted it to help me with the flying, so I went to North Carolina State [University] and I got a degree, a bachelor mechanical engineering degree with an aero option, so basically I had a mechanical and an aero degree. I was in the reserve, still, and I gained points by being there with the ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Corp] while I was in college. I just went to the drill and watched them and helped them a little bit there, wore my uniform, and so I was building up time as a reserve officer, is what it basically was.\\n\\n So I graduated with a degree, and jobs were extremely difficult at that time. That was in 1951. Very difficult. I went and took a government engineer's exam, and there were, I think, only two of us out of the class, or maybe three, that took it, and I passed it and I got job offers from all over the country. But I was notified that I was going to be recalled, because then there was the Korean War going on. So I went to Wright Field [Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio]. They told me to come to Wright Field, that I could just stay there. I could fly there or I could be there. So I did take the job with Wright Field, so I went there and I reported there the first day of July in 1951, after I graduated from State, in engineering degree. So that's how I sort of went from going through the engineering, never really expecting to use the engineering degree.\\n\\n Then, of course, the upshot of that was that I stayed at Wright Field, and then I was there for nine years, a little over nine years. It was probably some of the most wonderful experience that a person could ever have. I had the pleasure of having a B-47, the first B-47, for running tests on it. I [helped] put a drag cute and an approach chute on [it], working with the Germans. I was assigned to a bunch of Germans that [the USAF] brought over from the war, and they didn't know the military and they didn't know English very well either, and they certainly didn't know the military regulations. So I was assigned to [help] keep their writing straight, like, \"This remembers you.\" And I said, \"No, this reminds you.\" Then \"Would you borrow me a dollar?\" \"No, I will loan you a dollar.\" A lot of German words. So I became very good friends with the Germans.\\n\\n The reason I'm telling you this now is because they were in the Parachute Branch, and I got assigned to the Parachute Branch at Wright Field. I didn't select that; I was just assigned that. When I was hired, I was just put in the Research Section of the Parachute Branch when I went to work there. [My military reserve status] was how I went [to] Wright Field, [this] choice [was] mine.\\n\\n Gus Lundquist came to State, and at the time he was a major, I believe, for a year to get an advanced degree in the Aero Department, and also in nuclear engineering. Gus and myself became very good friends. When he found out I was going to Wright Field, he gave me all of the big wheels' names to go see, since he had been stationed there and had flown there. Gus flew everything, practically, that you can think of. Fact is, they had a Spitfire that was brought over to evaluate, and they brought it over on a ship, and Gus flew it back across the water. So he said he'd show them how to get it back over, rather than putting it on board a ship.\\n\\n But Gus was instrumental in getting me to the right people at Wright Field when I went in there, so I ended up doing a lot of flight-test work. I got assigned to [work with] these Germans and then we were into putting drag chutes on the airplanes. So, by and large, my time in the Research Section, I did a lot of things in parachutes. Every military airplane at the time[needed a drag chute]. The Germans would [help me each day]. They taught me how to use engineering practically, and I, in turn, kept all of their social skills and their writing and their reports straightened out.\\n\\n To this day, now, Theo Knocke, who is one of the primary fellows in that, is eighty-seven years of age, and he has written the bible on parachutes. This past summer, I flew back to California to see him. He lives in Carmel. He called me and said, \"John, you must come to see me.\" Now, he's had cancers and he also has had a heart problem, too. He and his wife live there in Carmel. So I met one of the Rockwell guys that I got assigned on the Apollo Program, with his wife [to drive] up there, and I took my grandson. I don't do so well seeing at night and driving, so my grandson is eighteen, so he went out there with me, and we just had a great time with Knocke and staying at Carmel, and we talked parachutes and all [about] the time back at Wright Field and my association. He calls and he gets to talking, and he switches into German. A lot of German I know.\\n\\n My son speaks German fluently. He graduated from [Texas] A&M [University]. I sent him to Germany and he studied in Germany. That's my second son. He's now married to a translator [who works at the Houston Intercontinental Airport], and he now switches between languages fluently. My older son also speaks German. His wife had German ancestors. So I have a German background and my dad did, but I know enough German to just get into trouble, not enough to really speak it."

        "utterance": "Oh, sure. One is, you've got an Orbiter drag chute. And at one time the first four flights on the Orbiter had ejection seats, and I put those on. I did everything and threatened to get fired by [Maxime A.] Faget if I said any more about ejection seats. We were going to have an airline-type operations, so after the first flights I had to pull the ejection seats off. Unfortunately, we should have had the ejection seats on there, still, personally, [I feel].\\n\\n But the first four ejection seats, we took an SR-71 Air Force high-altitude seat and we modified that. I got the permission from Lockheed and the Air Force. The modification primarily was on the SR-71, they don't have the inner module and the outer module, so on the Orbiter you've got pressure in a container, and then you've got the outer structure. So we had to cut both of those and we had to clear those out for the ejection seats. That had never been done before. So it took us a lot of time to come up with the inner one being smaller than the outer one, and then getting the two together. We had to put a series of connecting cables in the [two cut sections]. My ruling was, it had to be able to be ejected on the runway, not only in the air up to 70,000 feet, but if they touched down and had a problem, that they could still have a ground-zero capability.\\n\\n So we did test that. We tested on a rocket sled. I was the only one that had a secret classified safe in my office. We didn't have any classified data out there. So we had some classified data. But the Air Force had made three successful ejections at 70,000 feet in the SR-71 at the time that I was into that, and at a pretty high mach number.\\n\\n We had to do all the changes. The two seats sitting side by side, with the pilot and co-pilot for the two seats, we had to shorten the outer rail so when it came out, they would separate, so the outer one would come out. It would clear just a little bit before the others, so we would separate adequately on the ground. So we made changes like that.\\n\\n Then the survival gear, normally if you eject at 30 or 40,000, you have enough oxygen and all to get you back down again, but we were talking ejecting up to about 70,000 feet. At the rate it was going, we not only ejected at that altitude, but we'd go up another 10,000 feet before we started back down. So we had to have a long-time survival equipment, so we had to change all of the survival, the oxygen and the other for that. So it was modified for that.\\n\\n Bill [William W.] Lofland, who was an engineer that worked for me, was also at Wright Field as a lieutenant. I hired all the people that I knew and had experience with, basically, with I was here, when I came here. So he was the primary project engineer on that.\\n\\n Then [James] Kirby Hinson ended up being my assistant, and he's now just recently moved back to North Carolina. But he worked for me as a—I hired him. Let me tell you about Kirby, because this is all part of the story, too. Kirby was in a family of—they had four brothers, and they didn't have any money. Family didn't own a car. He was a very smart kid. They all were. He won a four-year scholarship for North Carolina State [University], where I went to school, in engineering from academic test in the state of North Carolina, so he had that. But in the course of his going to school, he didn't have any money to sustain him or help him, so in the summertime I could hire him like a co-op. I could hire him for like the three months. At one time I believe he stayed six, where he dropped out and stayed a longer time period so he could have some for clothes and food and things of that nature. He had enough to pretty well get him through the school. So Kirby came with me, and he worked on the drag chutes and all. That was good. Then, of course, when he graduated from school, he went to Langley [Research Center, Hampton, Virginia]. Then we'll get around to all that in a little bit.\\n\\n But you asked about other things. There were several things that I did that were very interesting. I did do the automatic opening devices for all personnel parachutes, and even at this time, if you eject, on the ground we finally had to—we didn't have a way of adjusting the time in the opening devices and the altitude properly, except I set the altitude on automatic opening devices for like 13,000 feet. That said if you ejected above 13,000 feet, when you hit 13,000 feet, then it's automatically opened. If you eject at lower than that, then I had just a timed delay. So you'd give like two seconds after you ejected, your parachute would automatically open. That was bad in some cases, because if you were at fairly high speeds, you really took a beating if you ejected. But we couldn't change the setup the way it was. But the automatic opening device proved to be a very, very fine help in getting pilots out, and getting them out and getting them out okay, especially if they ejected at high altitudes.\\n\\n Now with the technology, they can do most anything, really, to electronic timing and its senses of speed, so it could delay the inflation of the parachute. So we did some parachute changes to sort of help get by that. So that was one of the things that was different.\\n\\n The other is, and probably the one that I prided the most and still couldn't really tell anybody about it, is that we had a B-47 that we put a drag chute on, and that had a 32-foot [diameter] drag chute. The reason for that was, it had six jet engines on the B-47, and when you come in to land, it had such a flat glide angle and they didn't have any spoilers or anything that they could slow it up, they pulled the six jet engines back to idle power, which was about 60 percent of the engine, and the glide angle was so flat that touching down, we used a 10,000-foot runway. So they tried to put spoilers on it, they tried to do everything, and so I said, hey, I'll put a small parachute on it in addition to the 32-foot chute, so they can use that for drag, like I was putting out flaps or putting speed brakes out.\\n\\n They wanted to put speed brakes out, but they had two 9-bottle JATO [Jet Assisted Take Off] racks on the side of the airplane, so if they wanted to get off with a full load, they could do it and get out of a short runway, and so they couldn't do that. The wings, they were so loaded down with the engines and all, that there wasn't anyplace they could put a spoiler or flap or anything. And so I ended up cutting the tail off of the B-47. I had a [B-47 number] 0004, which was the fourth airplane off the assembly line for test purposes. And I cut the tail off, and I went in and I modified it, and I put a small—it was roughly a 16-foot approach parachute. And I flew tests with that chute and it just worked fine. They could hold about 80 percent power with that drag chute out, and they could come in without any trouble. If they needed to go around, they could go around. They had the power. They didn't have to wait for that eleven seconds to spool up the engines to go around. And they could climb 500 feet a minute with five of the six engines operating. They could lose one outboard engine and still make the go-around. So that was the requirements to do that.\\n\\n Well, [the Air Force was] doing atomic bomb tests, and I had a magic word, and the magic word, I could go in and could get anything done without any paperwork or anybody approving it or anything. So I went in and I modified the B-47 that they were going to drop the atomic bomb out [of] at Eniwetok [Proving Grounds, the U.S. nuclear test site in the Marshall Islands of the Pacific] out of, and I put that approach parachute on it. Then I had another one on the side, so I had two small parachutes. Then I had a 32-footer. The reason for it was, is the airport that they were flying from, every day they would have heavy rains, and if they flew early and got caught, they only had a Jap strip that was 4,000 feet long and water on both ends, that they could go to as an alternate if they were running low on fuel in the testing process. Well, sure enough, that happened, and they went into that little Jap strip and they put out all of this parachutes that I had, and they got stopped.\\n\\n So then the aircraft lab—and we had tested this too—developed another 33-bottle JATO [pack] that we could strap underneath the bottom of the B-47. Flew that over and they put it on there, and they flew it out of there with those 33 bottles and the two 9-bottles, and they got it out of that 4,000-foot strip, flew it back to the States, and they made the test.\\n\\n So they got back, and the major that was flying it called me up to thank me for saving the airplane and saving his neck. General Boyd wrote me a classified commendation for it, which I could never show to anyone. But I did all right as a result of it. So that was probably one of the highlights of all of my operation at Wright Field, was to have the major to come back.\\n\\n And I flew with them. I flew in the B-47 a lot, so I spent a lot of time in it. I had to ride an instrument seat. Then the first B-47s didn't have ejection seats, and so it took the first 400, and we had a lot of pilots that refused to fly them. So finally, on the 400th airplane, [the USAF] put a downward ejection seat in the front and then we had upward ejection in the other two, and they were slightly angled to miss that big vertical tail. So one would go to one side and one would go to the other side. Then one of our people in the Parachute Branch, one of the military guys, a sergeant, made the first downward ejection seat down in Florida, to make sure that the downward seat [would work. This was bad at] low altitude… I would ride in that front seat very often, [I knew] that I couldn't get out. On the airplane I didn't have ejection seats until very late.\\n\\n So we had a door that you would blow off and you had to jump through that little [opening] to get out, and you had a lanyard that you'd snap on the ripcord. What they did was, they'd recover your body if it was above about 180. So what I did was, was spray the bottom of the airplane with water, but I put cake coloring dye in it, and then I dropped dummies out of that, and I showed all the way—it put all of that dye on the dummies. Below 180, I could get out, but I couldn't get out above that. So when I got in the airplane and knew I was flying, I'd just take my parachute off, because I knew I couldn't get out of it.\\n\\n So then when we finally got ejection seats in the airplane to fly, then on takeoff [one day] we had an emergency on the B-47 on takeoff, and fortunately we got back okay. I said, \"Listen. If you say 'go,' you roll at 90 degrees so I can get out the bottom and y'all can get out.\" [Laughter] Pilot talk. I'll quit talking about that."

        "utterance": "I got up every day wanting to go to work, and I had so many interesting experiences at Wright Field. General Boyd would come there and wanting to fly, and I wouldn't be necessarily flying. I had a pickup truck and assigned where I could go on the flight line. I'd say, \"General, come on and go.\" And I'd just crawl in the back and put his parachutes in there, in the flight test. I was flying out of flight test, and take the pilot down and we'd take him to the airplane.\\n\\n So I would say that in all of it, and there were so many interesting experiences, as an example, we had a lieutenant that had been a lieutenant, and he was bald-headed completely, and he was always trying—he said, \"John, I've got to get the hair out of my eyes so I can see to fly.\" General Boyd called and wanted to fly to Seattle [Washington], to fly the first B-52, and so \"Pappy\" Campbell, I called him, the lieutenant came and they were flying the B-47 that I used for test purposes out there, and then they were going to fly the B-52 and then turn around and fly back. I was there when they loaded, and Pappy said, \"Hey, John, I'd better get a little food,\" which he did, and he got some sandwiches and stuff to take with him, and they flew out.\\n\\n They flew the B-52 and then they turned around and came back. They got in sort of late, and I was there again to take the equipment, some equipment off there. The general, when he got out, he said, \"Lieutenant, you did a fine job. I really appreciate it.\" So he goes on in to leave, and I said, \"Well, Pappy, you'll be a captain now,\" and the next morning he was a captain. [Laughter] And Pappy said, \"How did you know that?\" I said, \"I know General Boyd.\" He treated me so well.\\n\\n Kirby would take parachutes out there and load them, and I would, and we were treated—we went out there one day. Then I'll get off all this because I'm taking all your time. But we had the airplane ready to go, and the general wanted to fly at eight o'clock in the morning. That meant that he wanted to be off the ground at eight. He didn't want to be waiting on anyone. We got out there, and it was about, I'd say, a quarter till eight that he fired up the engines and taxied down to take off, and he ran up the engines, started running up the engines. Then all the power comes off and he starts taxiing back. I says, \"Oh, no, we've really got trouble.\" So he pulls up there on the flight line, and I release the hatch and I call up and I said, \"General, have you got a problem?\"\\n\\n He said, \"Yes, I've got a sticking throttle on the outboard engine.\"\\n\\n So I go down to the crew chief and I says, \"Hey, the general has got a problem with the engine. He's got a sticking throttle.\" So I said, \"General, why don't you come and let's just go and get a cup of coffee and donuts,\" which I could have then.\\n\\n He said, \"John, y'all just go on over there. I'll just wait for the crew to check that engine.\"\\n\\n And I said, \"Yes, sir,\" and so we got in the truck and we went over and we got a cup of coffee, and we were back in about fifteen minutes, and they were putting the cowling back on. Somebody had installed a bolt backwards and it was dragging on the throttle linkage and it was dragging the cowling. Normally it would take them four hours to pull that cowling off and put it back on, and in thirty minutes' time he fired up the engine and then they flew all the tests for us and came back, and I picked him up. I picked up the general and took him back, and I went back out to the flight crew and I said, \"I now know how fast you can take that cowling off and fix an engine, so don't give me any more of this four-hour stuff on my airplane.\" [Laughter]"

        "utterance": "I left Wright Field in '59 and I went to the Army. And let me tell you all of my reactions, and I'll tell you why I went to Wright Field. I was eligible for a GS-13, and I had the time in, but they only wanted to make supervisors GS-13s, so I applied for other jobs at Wright Field, being married and my wife had polio and was in the hospital for two years, and I needed money. So I went to my boss, and he was a really good guy, and I said, \"Well, hey, Shep, I think I deserve a 13.\" And he said, \"Well, yeah, you do, but you know we don't have any supervisor positions open right now.\"\\n\\n So I found a position in the structures lab where they had structural problems with the B-47 and the B-52, low primarily because of their low-altitude flying, so they had to limit that and they had to limit the speed. I thought that would be a good career change for me, was just to go to the structures operation. So they promised me the job, and they cut the paperwork for me, and I had to go to California on a B-52 accident, and I was gone two weeks. When I came back, my boss came in and he laughed, he said, \"You thought you were going to transfer. While you were gone, the paperwork came in and I wouldn't approve it.\"\\n\\n And I said, \"Well, Shep, I have two choices. I stay here, and I like the work, or I can find a job somewhere else.\" So the people at Fort Eustis [Virginia], I went around and I got job offers a number of places, but my wife, from the polio, I needed the warmer weather and I needed water for a physical therapy-type thing. We really had suffered of that. So Fort Eustis promised me a job flying and promised me the promotion and I could get a helicopter rating, which is what I wanted. So that's why I left Wright Field and went to the Army.\\n\\n I stayed there one year, and the promotion didn't come through. \"We're going to get it tomorrow,\" and tomorrow and tomorrow, and, \"We're going to get the helicopter rating,\" and I flew a lot of helicopters, but they would have sent me to helicopter school so I could fly and I could be a civilian test pilot for the Army. That's what I was looking for.\\n\\n So in the course of all of that, and then we'll get around to the Sputnik and all, lo and behold, Kirby Hinson was at Langley, who had been with me, and he comes over with a fellow from the Space Task Group, and they said, \"We called Wright Field and we needed somebody with mechanical and parachute experience and flying experience, and they said, 'Well, John Kiker's at Fort Eustis. Contact him.'\"\\n\\n So they came over. I had taken all of the parachute drawings and stuff with me, so I had all of the parachute data and the manuals. When I went to the Parachute Branch, I went to the shop and I says, \"Okay, fellas, I want y'all to teach me how to use every sewing machine, and then I want to learn how to pack every parachute.\" And none of the other engineers did that. The people down at the shop said, \"Well, we haven't had anybody ask that.\" I said, \"I want to know how to make—\" because we had to make the drawings. I says, \"I want to know what you can sew and what you can't, what type machines, and then I want to know what I'm involved in with packing the parachutes.\" So I did that.\\n\\n At Fort Eustis I wasn't really scheduled to do that. They did want an ejection seat for the military planes and I did go through that process in that one year's time. So I had that. So then Kirby and this guy comes over, and so in about a week they called me up and they said, \"Well, why don't you come over and we'll hire you. You just come to this Mercury Program.\"\\n\\n I said, \"What's Mercury?\" So then they told me, and then, of course, from Sputnik. My reaction was that it was the most unbelievable—I mean, I just couldn't even think in terms of putting something up and go into the velocities that would be in orbit and then coming back okay. Then when they told me they were going to do Mercury, you know, they were going to put a man in the thing, I said, \"You're going to do what?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, we're going to put a man in space and we're going to do this.\"\\n\\n And I said, \"Well, I can't get a promotion here,\" to myself, and I went in to the boss. The boss just died with cancer. The boss was in, and I remained very good friends with he and his wife over the years. Unfortunately, I found out he had cancer about six months ago, and he didn't live but just a short while after that. So I said, \"Yeah, I got to stay here a year, and I don't have long to finish that year,\" because they paid my moving expenses and I had to stay the year for them to pay the moving expenses.\\n\\n So I stayed the year, and then I immediately transferred to the Space Task Group at Langley. So that's how it all came about."

        "utterance": "Well, let me tell you that I was one of the few, and probably, basically, maybe the only one that I knew that I did a lot of wind tunnel testing for the Air Force at Langley, and fact is, I did the first supersonic parachute testing, model testing, at Langley in that ten-by-ten supersonic tunnel. I also went to the NASA-Cleveland [Lewis Research Center, Ohio—now Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field] wind tunnel and I tested a bomb with a parachute, stabilization, in their ten-by-ten, because they could go up to higher mach numbers, and I wanted to be able to test that.\\n\\n The reason for doing that was at Wright Field, out of the B-47 we had a 50,000-pound capability. We could take one bomb 50,000 pounds or we could take a stack of other bombs, but the other bombs, we had a flow problem when we dropped them out, and they'd go every direction with the fins. So the accuracy was pretty poor in the bombing.\\n\\n So if we took the fins off and put a parachute stabilization on the back of that, we didn't have that problem. Later, the aircraft lab put a spoiler arrangement, so on the B-47, when you open the bomb bay doors, you have flow straighteners, what I call flow straighteners, where, like in a tunnel, you put all the vanes. So that dropped down and then that made it possible. But they did use the bomb stabilization, and I have not seen it, but I'm sure that it's not classified now. But when you drop an atomic bomb, unless you're at very high altitude, if you want to come in low to the ground, you do what they call a labs maneuver, which you pull up vertical and then you come over in an Immelman, but as you're coming up vertical, you release the bomb. The bomb goes up and the parachute comes out and it comes down, and then the airplane does an Immelman and then it's clear by the time the atomic bomb goes off.\\n\\n So I was into that, and I was testing the basic parachute particulars, stabilization system. One of the things that was sort of in the background of being involved was, how could we do that. Unfortunately, the B-47, they were practicing down in Florida and doing the labs maneuver—and we did it at Wright Field, we took the water tanks for a big day where they had all the military guys to come down, and they used colored water in the wing tanks, and it was beautiful to see it come across and pull up and do an Emmelman with the colors. I've got pictures of that. But they went down to Florida and did that, and when they got right at the top and came across, the wings came off and the pilots were killed.\\n\\n So they went in and they had to modify all of the B-47s, and they put about a three-quarter-inch steel plate all through the fuselage and out the wing, and if you see any in museums now, you'll see that it's been modified. A few of them had those metal plates. I can remember that part of it, too.\\n\\n But going to Langley, my reaction to Langley is twofold. Number one, at that point in time the Langley people were notoriously—Langley Research Center, promotions and everything was based on doing research and writing reports. If you wanted to get a promotion, you had to do some form of wind tunnel testing or come up with some project, and then you might run data for so long, and then you sit down and you'd write a report. The NASA reports would have to go through a Review Board. I mean, when they got through with it, it was really reviewed, and you probably wouldn't recognize the report by the time they got through with that. But the NASA reports were worldwide known at that time and even today, the Langley reports, for their being good, good data, and for everyone. I mean, everyone can use them. General aviation, whatever, they do that.\\n\\n When the Space Task Group moved in, they took people from all of the Centers and they brought them in there, plus the Langley people, and there were some what were there for a short time and some that ended up moving there. Then they had the Canadians [AVRO engineers] to come in, and the Canadians' aviation world and aircraft world collapsed, so they had all of these engineers, so they were brought down. They were hired and brought down, and they moved down, and they made a very good contribution. They made a good contribution in several ways. Number one, where Langley was short on experience and building like aircraft, or building things, they had a lot of people that had been building airplanes.\\n\\n Fact is, the Canadians came to me while I was at Wright Field, and I tested their drag chute system for one of their last fighter airplanes, and they put it on. I have a picture of it that they sent to me after they put the parachute on. I had a B-26 Wingless Wonder. I had a B-26 airplane…[with] the wings off of and…a spoiler strip on there, and then I put a parachute compartment on the back of it. Then I could test all sizes of parachutes up to 32 feet. I'd go down to the end of the runway and then we could get to 150 miles an hour at midpoint of the runway. Then if the parachute didn't come out or we had a problem, we could just get stopped by the end of the 10,000 feet. So that was the way we tested the drag chute. So we had that capability.\\n\\n The other thing that was at Wright Field that was sort of a carryover for me is that we made our own drawings, we took them down and manufactured the parachutes. Then we took them over to Wright Field and we tested them. This was true with personnel parachutes and all. We had a drop zone and we'd drop them and test them there. Then the drawings would be given to a manufacturer, and they would make their own drawings and then they'd manufacture them. That was true with personnel chutes as well. Although we had the parachute manufacturers, basically the designs were done at Wright Field. They had engineering capability at that time. So that's a little bit of the background.\\n\\n So when it comes to the Space Task Group, there was a small group of people, there was pretty much unlimited money. We had the test facilities. We had Ames [Research Center, Mountain View, California], where you could go out and test also in big wind tunnels. They had Edwards [Air Force Base, California], where all the flight testing could be done. We had Lewis, that was propulsion, and we had everything. Wallops Island, where we could test Mercury, with booster rockets. Of course, Dr. [Robert R.] Gilruth and [Maxime A.] Faget and Caldwell [C.] Johnson and all had been put in a group called PARD, Pilotless Aircraft Research Division, and they did a lot of the testing. By helicopter, they did parachute testing of the Mercury chutes right there in the back bay, right there from Langley, because it's right on the water. I mean, it sits right there on the water.\\n\\n So the thing I liked about it was, is it was a small organization and you could get things done. There was a lot of ease to see the bosses. The bosses were very competent. Dr. Gilruth was one of the finest individuals you could ever expect to know, and Dr. Faget was the best engineering director. He was so smart, and he understood people. He wasn't as good at managing people as he was technically. He was really good technically. I have to say that I was treated absolutely superb. In a nutshell, I was in the right place at the right time, with the right experience, and every day I couldn't wait to go to work.\\n\\n Langley always had a monthly meeting where someone would have to give a big presentation, someone out of Langley, and you'd have a little sort of dinner and all. The director of Langley at the time would always come in and he'd ask one question. He'd say, \"What is the Reynolds number effect?\" And so you could just know anybody that was giving a talk, they'd ask you what the Reynolds number effect was, whatever you were doing. That was always of interest to me.\\n\\n But it was a very fine place to work, and I didn't want to leave Langley. Obviously that becomes another whole story about how Johnson Space Center was selected, or Houston was selected. But at Langley and the NASA people, by and large, all of them were very well qualified and did a great job and we had great support. I still just love to go to Edwards. Milt [Milton O.] Thompson died with cancer. He got the drag chute test done while he was out there. He just let me go do anything. I'd go to the shop and make something if I needed it. Of course, I spent all my time with the Air Force there, you know, so I knew him from my Air Force testing. I tested a lot of things for the Air Force out at Edwards, spin chutes and a lot of other things.\\n\\n So my feeling about NASA was, it was great. And it was great to come down here. The choice of coming to Houston certainly has been all right. It grew by leaps and bounds and gave everyone, like me, authorization to go hire whoever I could hire that I thought was qualified, and I hired people from Rice University. I went all around the country to universities. We had some really fine people. It was a very dedicated group of people. A lot of times it was a lot of rivalry and trying to take everybody's job or get recognition for something. I'd have to say that from my perspective, anything that I have done, anything that I have done is because I had such fine people and such fine support from everywhere.\\n\\n The only thing that does not fall in that category is the [Boeing] 747 Orbiter piggyback [concept] was done only and entirely by me. Fact is, I had to send a—I wrote up all of that. I came because I knew airplanes and how to modify them, and I had done things at Wright Field and [seen] dropped things out of airplanes, F-84Fs out of the bottom of B-36s. So I had all of the experience and I had the mechanical experience, and I ran through all of that situation.\\n\\n Unfortunately, that ended up being a big problem in getting approved, but I sent a letter and called a fellow at NASA headquarters, and I said, \"Send a directive to the Johnson Space Center to do the 747 Orbiter piggyback, because that's the right way to go.\" I had written it up, and I had made all the drawings on my desk, and I'd done all the analysis, and no one knew what I was doing. Even my own people didn't know. I had forty people, and I'd give each one a little job to run some numbers for me, but they didn't know what I was going to do. Then when I had it all drawn and agreed to, I got one of the guys in the office—and I started to bring the drawing for you, where they signed it.\\n\\n Then my friend at NASA headquarters, now lives in Boulder, Colorado, he sent the TWX [teletype transmittal, pronounced “twix”] down to do it, and Dr. [Christopher C.] Kraft [Jr.] called me in and says, \"Well, it looks like we're going to have to do what you want to do with the 747 Orbiter piggyback.\" And that was the right way to do it. That's the only way. If it had landed out at White Sands [Proving Ground, New Mexico] like it did, and we hadn't had it, it would still be sitting out there as a monument."

        "utterance": "Well, primarily the Mercury Program was in progress. Now, believe it or not, I had been contacted relatively to some of the parachutes, a potential parachute from Kirby and what they were planning to use before I left Wright Field. So I had had a little indications of some of the things that they were thinking about. The company that ended up getting the contract to build the Mercury parachute did a lot. I had done a lot of things with them and had known them in other areas, so I had had experience around.\\n\\n So I guess I would have to say that John [B.] Lee was sort of the big man, and he was sort of an assistant to Dr. Faget. There was Bill [William W.] Petynia, and I can't remember the other guy's name. They had three studies for Apollo all going on while the Mercury—I mean, sort of thinking down range from the Mercury standpoint.\\n\\n The Mercury parachute system was built by Radio Plane [Company, Burbank, California], and Radio Plane was started by Reginald Denny [phonetic] into remotely piloted vehicles. He started it out as a movie thing where he had a radio-controlled model. Shirley Temple was in the movie and in an airplane flying thing, and he had this radio-controlled model. He got into building and selling model airplanes, and then it generated into the Radio Plane Company. It was the Radio Plane Company, and then he got out of it. It was sold. I don't know who, actually, bought out, who the people bought it out.\\n\\n But this is the final project report on Mercury landing systems qualification, part one, Salton Sea [California] drop test program. Now, this is the thing that no one has wanted in all of the other data. It has everything in here about it. The Salton Sea is very close to El Centro [California]. Going from L.A. [Los Angeles, California], it's about 200 miles down to El Centro.\\n\\n The Salton Sea is just over the mountains. They expected that to be a great resort area, and they poured concrete. They were going to build all these houses. That concrete's still there, but there's no houses there. The salt water was so salty that couldn't any fish live in it. Then they found a fish that could live in there, and they stocked it with that. I think it just goes great with these particular fish. But that's about, I suspect, 80 feet below sea level.\\n\\n You fly right over it if you're going from L.A., or you do, going down to El Centro, you go right over the mountains or you can go down the coast to there. But El Centro is probably 130 or 40 miles or 50 miles west of San Diego. Many times—I made like twenty-two trips out there one time in about a three-month time period. I'd fly out early and I'd go into L.A., and then you take a puddle-jumper and you'd land a couple of stops and land at San Diego [California]. Then you'd fly over the mountains and land at El Centro.\\n\\n El Centro was a small place, and there's some big area of the Navy and the Air Force test facility at the time for parachuters, a naval test facility and the Air Force test facility. There was a corridor down the building, and the Air Force was on one side and the Navy on the other side. Unfortunately, Howard Fish, who was head of the Navy at the time, he, for some reason, didn't put any effort into doing the job for NASA, but the Air Force did. So the Air Force got all the work, and when I went to Apollo after the Mercury days, I went back [unclear] Apollo, and he wasn't seemingly interested at all in the Air Force [unclear] Knocke left Wright Field and went out there as the director of that. So he was director.\\n\\n The fellow that I got all the parachute knowledge from, he was the director of the Air Force and he moved quite a few people from Wright Field, transferred them out there to start the Air Force parachute test facility. So you had all the airplanes and everything there, so that was the primary test facility for the parachutes. Now it's been moved up to another area, and the Navy runs all of that now. So anytime you want parachute tests, that's where. China Lake is the other place. But El Centro has—and that's where the Blue Angels train when they want good weather. The Navy had a big contingency and they still have some Air Force operations there, but I'm not sure just exactly about that.\\n\\n This is the typical-type document and this is the outfit. It's one of those things that the Radio Plane Company changed names to Northrop-Ventura, and the Northrop-Ventura, it was all the same operations, but this place was located at Van Nuys [California], right there on the airport at Van Nuys. Then they bought a lot of land and they moved out close really to Carmel. They have a big facility, a beautiful facility, and they are out in the middle of nowhere now, just all built up around it. They built a very fine facility and they did the parachute work there, the engineering thing.\\n\\n The parachute manufacturing was located in El Paso [Texas] at that time, and El Paso was the location because they got cheap Latin American or Mexican labor, and they had a very good parachute facility. The guy that was in charge of that later moved out of there and they moved that facility and did away with it. He later became head of Irving's Parachute outfit, and now they've changed that again, so he's no longer there. They moved their facility. Irving's moved their facility from California, now up to Fort Bragg, Bedford, North Carolina. So it's all been moved around. Pioneer still stayed in the general area where they are, and they're doing this X-38 parachute system, the engineering part of it, but they moved their production to Jackson, Mississippi, I believe is where they're located now. So that's a little bit of the background."

        "utterance": "I have a different philosophy from what is done now. You have a contractor inspector, like Northrup-Ventura or Radio Plane had to have an inspector when they manufactured parachutes and when they were getting ready to do any testing. They had to have an inspector to do that. Then the government would have an inspector to check that. Now, all the procedures for what should be checked were supposed to have been submitted, and were submitted, to like my people if it was a parachute like Apollo. They had to submit a document and we'd have a big review, and we'd go through everything and change it, include a redo or whatever.\\n\\n And besides that, I wouldn't let anything go unless one of my men signed it or I signed it or I checked it. And that's not true now. The X-38, the people out here, they have all this parachute business and they have a flight readiness review, and they do it over a telephone. I say, how many of you have packed a parachute, looked at a parachute, seen a parachute, handled a parachute, tested a parachute, and all the associated hardware related to it? Drop it out of an airplane, extract it out of an airplane? There's a technique in extracting a load out of an airplane or dropping it out of an airplane or dropping it out of a B-52. They are hiring a lot of support people to do these things now.\\n\\n So it's changed. It's changed down here now from a \"Do it, NASA,\" to, \"Hire somebody to do it, NASA.\" And I'm not saying that's at all wrong, but I ask the people, \"If any one of you three would go out and buy an automobile?\" Well, you don't even go look at it or do any planning, you just say, \"I want a car,\" so you just take the car. Now, if it's me, and I have a two-year-old car and I have a Toyota Camry, I went and I listed all of the automobiles, the gas mileage, the trunk space, the safety. I got every data and I put them all down. Then I went to the computer and I got the prices and all of the taxes and the shipping and all, and I had all of that. Then I had a color and a car and what I wanted, and I bought what I wanted.\\n\\n Now, how, when you've got—I'll give you an example—three people to come back from a Space Station, you say that, and you're going to bring them back and you're going to hopefully put a gliding parachute out successfully, and hopefully you're going to land on some spot successfully and you're going to attenuate them so they don't get killed from that. How can you do the job if you haven't looked at the hardware, if you haven't built hardware, if you don't understand hardware, along with the other areas? Or else you've got to have some mighty fine people signing it off.\\n\\n So the area now is, from my perspective, is at the time I was in NASA with Dr. Gilruth and Dr. Faget and Dr. Kraft, I was given a job to do, and I'd get a phone call from Dr. Gilruth to come to his office. I'll tell you one example of what he did. Dr. Faget would sit down around the table, and when I put the Orbiter on top of the 747 and do that, he picked up the phone and called his aerodynamics people and talked to them. He had them on the speaker phone. And when he got through, he said, \"John, I should hire me a high school aerodynamicist around here to do that job for you.\" So that was the only time I ever heard him make a derogatory remark. He was very put out because they hadn't done the job.\\n\\n At the time I provided them with about twelve boxes of data from Boeing on their propulsion, their structures, and the aerodynamic data, and I provided the same on the C-5 from Lockheed, and I got it because of my contacts with the flight tests of the two groups. They sent me that without any piece of paper or anything. I said, \"I want your aerodynamic data, your propulsion data, and your structures data, but I'm not going to tell you what I'm going to do with it.\" And they sent it to me, delivered it to me, aerodynamic data and propulsion data. Wouldn't anybody look at it. Said, \"You can't do it.\" So I just took my own people and did it.\\n\\n So isn't it interesting. Times change, and now it's the situation, is that they want to manage things and there are a lot of good people. Carlisle [C.] Campbell, who's still out there in the landing gear on the orbiter out of school and he has two degrees, he's just a fine individual, and he can do any kind of job. He can do analytical, he can do hardware, he can do testing. He just knows the gamut. He knows the people. But they are few and far between now. He just loves his job and people sort of leave him alone because he's the only one who really knows what to do, and he has the wheels, tires, and breaks under him now. I mean, he oversees [everything].\\n\\n But it was all done by the Air Force. The Air Force did all the testing and now they’re fixing to shut down their facilities up there. They're going to go to contract. So they're wondering what they're going to do with testing wheels and tires and brakes and landing gears for Orbiters or anything, because that's where the best facility is, as far as I know, in the world.\\n\\n So that's sort of my personal feeling, and everything I'm saying is strictly John Kiker, no one else."

        "utterance": "Well, I can give you a specific example. In the first place, I had across from my office, about as close from here to your people videotaping all this and recording it, every file on every military airplane classified and otherwise, ones that were planned, ones that were flying, and it was a big area. I made a chart, and in school I learned this too, from a professor there who had been in industry. I made a big, big chart, and I listed all of the data on the airplanes. I listed the wing areas, the tail areas, the weights, the engines, and when the spec was written, what they predicted, and what they flew.\\n\\n And from what was the original specs, the B-[47] was scheduled to fly at 120,000 pounds, and that was it. They later changed that to 190,000 pounds and they air-to-air refueled it, and then they couldn't land till they got down to 120,000, so if you had any problems, you were there. I mean, you had to fly it out. You couldn't get rid of it. So I looked at it.\\n\\n It had grown so tremendously and then they wanted other performance figures and they had to modify it, and that's typical of all airplanes. So the B-52, it started out at a fairly lightweight, I'll say 250, [to] about 300 [thousand] pounds, and now it flies like at 425,000 pounds, roughly that. So it was a big increase. So then they had to do beefing-up of structure and you had to change things.\\n\\n The Mercury capsule, I think, was originally scheduled to be like about, I would to say, like 1,700 pounds, maybe, total, and it ended up flying like about 2,775. The Gemini, McDonnell was very good, very good, one of the best contractors I've ever worked with. The Gemini vehicle, they ended up saying they were going to fly at about 4,400 pounds total, and they flew it about that. So they did a very good job and they learned from the Mercury days, and they did that.\\n\\n The Apollo weight was to be 7,800 pounds for three people and all of this, and I had plotted all this and I had about a 30 percent increase from what had been predicted to where you were going to fly. So I go down to Caldwell Johnson and I talk to him, and I said, \"Hey, you better send them a TWX out there and design the parachute system for 10,000 pounds.”\\n\\n He said, \"Ten thousand pounds?\"\\n\\n I said, \"Yeah, you'd better change it. We'd better do that.\"\\n\\n He said, \"That's too high.\" So he sent them a letter saying to go to 9,500 pounds ultimately they went like that. I said, \"Hey, I’d do that.\"\\n\\n [Joseph N.] Kotanchik then, the course, it was split off and Caldwell went one way with the design group, and then Kotanchik had Structures and Mechanics Division, and I was left in the Structures and Mechanics Division. Then later Caldwell go me transferred back over his division, so I went over to Spacecraft Design Division. But Kotanchik, he didn't know anything [about chutes]. I call him a bean bender. He still, if he was living today, he probably would hit me over the head, and he wanted to, because that's what I call the structures world, were been benders. He said that he had two bad guys working for him. One was Kirby Hinson and the other one was John Kiker. But I knew too many people and I did a job, and they liked what I did. He sort of left me alone, you know. He really was a very dedicated man.\\n\\n He ended up dying with a heart attack out there at the Center. I knew that he was having some illness, but he wouldn't admit to it. I asked him, point blank, if he was having some trouble with his heart and all, and he denied it. Then it wasn't more than a couple of weeks after that, that he did die out there from the heart attack.\\n\\n But what it did for me was, is that it gave me a feel for what is put on paper to sell by a contractor and then the requirements that you put in, and then as you get smarter you add to those requirements to do things or increase it or whatever, and it grows, and you find more things you can do for the benefit of others with that. So I foresaw, and I guess maybe other people did, too, but they maybe didn't complain as much as I did, but that the parachute system, I was really in a box to put it in the three compartments on the top of Apollo. I could not meet one requirement that way. The requirements, up until that time with Apollo, was that everything would have a redundant system. Like Mercury had a parachute, but if you had a problem and you could get rid of it and you could put out another parachute. That was the rule of the game as best you could do that.\\n\\n Came around to Gemini, and Gemini was going to go with a paraglider, which I got very involved in and very vocal that they would never make the paraglider work, nor could they package it and put it in there. They ended up going with the Mercury-type parachute. In fact, it's the same people built that, and it was just bigger.\\n\\n So in the course of all of it, on Apollo it was so. I had all the data from Wright Field, because I had pressure-packed parachutes there for special weapons, so I knew I had tables with all of the volumes of parachutes and how big they were and what kind of package I thought I could get them in.\\n\\n Apollo, when they started out, then it started creeping up. It went up, you know, over 8,000 pounds, then it went to 9,000 pounds. Of course, the thing that—and finally it was increased to actually over 13,000 pounds, and we made an actual flight where it was at least 13,000 pounds, and it seemed like it was a little bit more than that. It was very close to that, anyway.\\n\\n So it started out in the first parachutes and all were really being designed for the light weights. So then all of a sudden, with the way we had to put the three parachutes, I wrote up the requirements. I had done cluster parachute testing that any two would do the job. So I had one backup, but I didn't have a full backup, like it should have been two parachutes or it should have been ejection seat. It should have been something if you said you had to have complete redundancy.\\n\\n But in the Apollo, it was set up so that with three parachutes, if you lost one, you would have a rate of descent that everything and the crew would survive okay. As you probably know, one flight, one parachute was burned off and it did land on two and it was fine, although the crew said it sure was a mighty strong thump when they hit that water. Of course, it was hung at a 27-and-a-half-degree angle, so for impact it would deep dive. That took the attenuation.\\n\\n Plus, the crew seats, at least under me which had been—they had attention there, you had a stroke that would go forward. You had a stroke that could go sideways, and you had a stroke that could go through vertical, and, of course, lying down, the way they are, they could take these loads as an optimum. That was the best position they could do.\\n\\n So going with the three parachutes, it presented a real problem from the parachute standpoint, because normally you pull a pilot parachute out and then you pull the other parachutes with that, and you have a cluster. Well, the only way you can get three parachutes out together successfully, basically is to have, in the three parachutes that I deployed, and I've deployed as many as four in test behind a B-47, I had one bag with three parachutes in the bag, and one pilot chute. You could pull it off and it stripped all three, and they all came out together. Now, I did differently with the approach parachute, but all the skirts even.\\n\\n Well, on the Apollo, if I had put pilot chutes out, I'd have had three pilot chutes streaming back, and the chances of one going inside the other. The Russians lost astronauts because they had a parachute that entangled within a parachute. They had a malfunction and one put out and it went within in, and they lost a crew. So what we did, this was a logical thing to do, was we put three mortars in the three compartments and we fired them out 90 degrees to line stretch. If one went out 90 degrees and one went out 90 degrees and one 90 degrees here, and it didn't matter where it was, then they would swing back and by the time they swung back, they were inflating and they didn't entangle. Then after they were inflated, when you have three parachutes inflated, the flow around one and the flow around the other one, they moved forward. You ended up, they sort of bounced around a little bit, but there's not any together, it just stays there.\\n\\n You know, and the military will put out as many as eight or nine 100-foot-diameter parachutes with big payloads. They'll go up [with] a bulldozer and they'll drop it. Fact is, they've got a big chart. Depending on what the weight is, they've got attenuation that they put on this crushable honeycomb and it's in layers. So if they got a jeep, they put like three layers of crushable honeycomb and then they'll put out a 60-foot chute, and then they'll drop that. Then they'll come with a bulldozer and down at Fort Bragg, and I spent many hours down at Fort Bragg in the Army. They'll go in there and they'll say, oh, that weighs 20,000 pounds, so we need to put six parachutes, so they just grab six parachutes and then they're all deployed out with one pilot chute, so that’s how they do it. So, Apollo, that [was a different requirement and problem].\\n\\n Then we ran into another problem at that same time that we later had to do something about it, and we were sort of fat, dumb, and happy about it. I was. When that apex cover is blown off, it is blown off pyrotechnically, and it's just a perfect, stable vehicle, it goes off and then it turns upside down, and that cone shape is just perfectly stable. So on one of the missions, the parachutes all inflated, and all of a sudden on the film, you can see that apex go whizzing by, right by parachutes, it doesn’t hit the parachutes, but you could see it and it was pretty close. So we went back and put a parachute to recover that apex cover at a slower rate of descent than the others. So we learned a lot of lessons, all from testing and seeing. That was an actual flight that we'd run into [the apex cover problem]."

They had the flagpole up on the top of the steps, and the principal and the head teacher would always, they would have a little speech in, in Tagalog, not in the local language, not in English, but in Tagalog. And then they would raise the flag. All the kids would, would say a sort of a pledge of allegiance in their own, in Filipino, which was Tagalog, and then sing at least one song, the national anthem.

And I made my own rain gauge, and there were some books that were sent to us about how to make things, and I was into that. So I made a weather station and, and so. Let's see. Oh, I was teaching, I was helping this teacher to teach about condensation. And you know, where, where the rain goes. You know, if it falls, then where does it go? And it goes into the air. So the only place that had ice in the town was the mayor's house. They had a generated, you know, a generator powered refrigerator. So they had ice all the time. And so sometimes we would have ice cold beer there.\n\nSo anyway, so I, during this noon break, I went to the mayor's house and requested a bag of ice. And rather than a bowl of ice, I wanted a bag of it, a plastic bag of some kind. And because I wanted to show the condensation. So by the time I had left the mayor's house, the rain had started and it was pouring rain. I mean, really pouring. And I had just a hat on and no coat or anything, and just I was just getting soaking wet. And it was about almost a mile from his house to the school. So I was, I had, but the only way to get there was through the main, you know, just the main crossroads of the town. And then that road led to the road up to the school. So all the people and the town just take their break and eat and sit around under big verandas and things to keep out of the rain and just watch the rain. And that's their, just their social time.\n\nSo here was the Peace Corps guy with this bag of ice running through the rain through the main square of the town up to the school. And I didn't hear anybody laughing, but I thought, boy, what a fool I look like. I really must look like a real big fool. But I brought the ice to school and did my lesson and taught about condensation, and we poured it in the glass, into glasses or something, I think it was glass to show the condensation on the outside. And then we went into the rain cycle and the water cycle. But that was just a vivid memory of myself going through the town."

I had sent home a big thing, you know, shipment, you know, freight on freight, surface freight, of all my possessions and everything. Had my suitcase, got on the bus that takes nine hours to get to Dumaguete or, I'm sorry, Bacolod City. And the only way out of town was by the cemetery. And I was, let's see, was Roger with me? I think he was not with me. He had either gone ahead or I think he had gone ahead the day before.\n\nSo I was alone on this bus with other Filipinos, though, and the bus went by this cemetery and all the people, you know, I was at the window and I was waving at them and they were waving at me.

Going out in a car on dirt, dirty, bumpy roads and going into very small areas where there were hogans and just a small group of people, which is the traditional way of living in Navajo. And they would ask how many children they have and any new children this year, and who's going to be five? And they would tell them, sign them up right there. And the parents had to bring the student to the school, leave them off, and say goodbye for until Christmas. Five year olds. And they would cry for two weeks. And they were in a dormitory with non Navajo people. Although some of the aides and people were Navajo, but they were completely different, no familiarity."

I was learning Navajo from a minister, what do you call him? A missionary. And I was just loving everything about it, except the BIA. I couldn't take the BIA and the principal. I hope he hears this somehow, or it gets back to the government, that he was a Mormon. He was narrow minded. He had been in the army and reached a certain GS level, like 14. So they put him in as a principal. He knew nothing about education, nothing about Navajos, nothing about children, nothing about anything. He was a miserable creep. And we all thought that.

      "description": "Scott Zoromski served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Honduras from 1978 to 1980 as an industrial arts teacher. He applied to the Peace Corps after two years of college, hoping the experience would give him clarity on what he wanted to do with his life. After ten weeks of teacher training at the University of Wisconsin-Stout, he continued training in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Zoromski was assigned to teach industrial arts in a secondary school in Olanchito. The school was built and equipped with help from USAID. Zoromski also helped construct a new schoolhouse in a nearby town on weekends. After completing his bachelor's degree, he went on to a life-long career in teaching. He remained in close touch with his Honduran friends, and finally had the chance to return to Honduras to visit them in 2016. Interviewed and recorded by Phyllis Noble, April 8, 2016. 2 digital audio files (web streaming files combined into 1 file).",

But that's another story and I don't know much about them.\n\nBut anyway, we went there because we didn't have school to teach and somebody came up with an idea that we were going to build a raft, raft it down a major river system to the mouth where it met the sea, to go out to a ship, to put lumber on the raft from the ship, and then take the lumber back to the mainland and rebuild a small village that had been devastated by a hurricane."

I currently live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and I work for an organization, a nonprofit environmental organization called Friends of Milwaukee's Rivers. My title is Milwaukee Riverkeeper. So what that means is I basically identify sources of pollution and try to come up with solutions to those problems. I actively patrol the waterways looking for sources of pollution, and we also do education, river cleanup, restoration type projects, as well as some litigation. So. And other current interests are, you know, hiking, camping. I love to canoe and just enjoy Milwaukee as well. Listen to music and do community service, of course."

        "utterance": "Hmm. OK. Well, I, I think like a lot of volunteers, joined Peace Corps fairly quickly after I graduated from school. So the year before I left, I was finishing up my senior year of college. I was attending college at University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign and was studying to be a biology major. And I graduated, I believe, in May or late May or early June of '04 ['94] and was actually, you know, planning to leave for a Peace Corps assignment fairly quickly. After that, however, and I can't even remember where it was, but I was supposed to be sent to another country and I believe it was Guatemala. But there were some issues, safety issues, concerns. So I ended up not being able to leave right after graduation and was given basically a choice of going to Ecuador, going to Bolivia, and I believe going to the Dominican Republic.\n\nI wanted to go to a Spanish speaking country. I had some Spanish experience in college and high school and just really felt that that would be a good experience to have a better command of Spanish and that would be marketable in the future. So, I mean, it was kind of a crazy year waiting. I was kind of a, especially graduating from school and being kind of in limbo. But I ended up spending probably five or six months essentially just visiting with family and doing temp work and kind of preparing to leave. So I did have some time to prepare and kind of focus on what I was going to be doing. But it was, you know, it was a busy year going through all the health screenings and the logistical hoops that are required when you want to become a Peace Corps volunteer. But it was, you know, an exciting year as well."

You know, I was really, you know, I think, like many people, just really idealistic and really wanted to take a few years before I joined the rat race to, you know, like give back and go somewhere else and make a, you know, make a difference or try to make a difference in a developing country. And I was just really excited, I mean, as a biologist, very interested in and going and experiencing, you know, another country, especially. I was really excited about going to South America in particular and really, you know, not only helping the people, but to experience a different culture and experience a different, you know, different natural surroundings. And, you know, to try to use some of my scientific skills for good in another country.\n\nSo I was very excited about going to Ecuador. I mean, they have unbelievable diversity in that country, you know, biologically speaking as well as, you know, culturally. And, you know, they have rainforest and mountains and beaches. And I was very excited about going there and, you know, working with different tribal groups as well. It's very much an interest of mine. So I was very excited about going to Ecuador, but, you know, really just wanted to go and spend a few years and try to make a difference somewhere."

I mean, I was interested in college, you know, to be, I wanted to be a Peace Corps volunteer and did attend some sessions that they had, which I have now participated in. But where, you know, you go to these sessions and people who had been volunteers before you kind of shared their stories. And I remember, in particular, dragging my mom to one in downtown Chicago that they had at the Chicago headquarters of Peace Corps and listening to everything. And afterward, my mom, and I remember we walked out and she said, oh, what a relief, because she just assumed that I would listen to all those stories and not want to go anymore. But I kind of came out of the meeting like, yes, you know, this is what I want to do and, you know, really invigorated by it. And she came out of it like, very scared and worried and pretty sure that I wouldn't want to do it anymore after I heard kind of some of the details.\n\nBut yeah, it's just something I had heard about. And I mean, obviously, you know, I think a lot of us have heard of Peace Corps and it was something I was definitely interested in but didn't know a whole lot about. But I did do a lot of research, talked to a lot of people before I left. And you know, I'm originally from Chicago, so I was lucky that we had a recruiter that I was able to meet with, you know, face to face and ask them a lot of questions as well and get more information that way."

Especially a country like Ecuador where you can be, you know, in the Andes or you can be on the beach, it's difficult to pack to say the least. But you know, my family was very concerned. I mean, you know, your parents are concerned about your safety and you know that was a, they were very trepidatious about it. A lot of my friends too who, you know, are very different than myself, you know, growing up in Chicago, didn't really understand why I would want to do something like this. Why would I want to go for two years to this developing country and help somebody else and not make any money and etcetera? And not potentially have, you know, electricity and running water. And you know, I had a lot of friends that were very also worried about my safety and very sad to see me go, certainly for a long period of time. But, you know, I had a lot of other people that were very supportive as well. And even I think despite their concern, they were still excited for me and happy for me to go, but just worried, worried about my safety I think more than anything."

So we received, and maybe I'm jumping the gun, but we received training in kind of forestry practices as well as kind of just general environmental education. And, you know, we also had other people that we trained with that were doing more agricultural training, small animal husbandry and organic farming. But we did learn a little bit about all of those different programs and ended up, you know, I think a lot of us doing work that kind of fit into multiple different program areas. But I was predominantly doing forestry extension, but certainly dipped into agriculture and environmental education as well."

I didn't really have any major investments or estate concerns, but I did give power of attorney to my parents and, you know, made sure that they had all the important information about my finances and just contact information and things like that. But I didn't really do anything major to prepare. I did end up, because I ended up having a few months before I went down because of delays with scheduling, I was able to audit some Spanish classes at a local university. And that was helpful because although I had taken probably five years of Spanish more or less, I think, in high school and college, I just wanted to brush up on Spanish, and so I did do a little bit of that. But that was about it. And just research on Ecuador and reading books. I mean, I actually read Mike Tidwell's book [Ponds of Kalambayi]. He was a Peace Corps Africa volunteer. It's a fairly famous one that I can't remember the title of. But, you know, did read some books about Peace Corps and some books about Ecuador as well."

        "utterance": "Yeah, training was fun. I mean, I just remember it being a really fun time, but, you know, stressful as well. But we trained for three months in a small town called Tumbaco, which was just outside of city limits of Quito, Ecuador. Really nice training facility there, very much kind of a, you know, campus environment, but where everything is pretty much, you know, outside. What is the word I'm looking for? You know, outside areas where we could do our training and we did have classrooms as well. But it was, the weather was so wonderful where we were in Quito, you know, we were able to kind of do a lot of training stuff outside as well. And it was just kind of a nice, almost like homey environment where people could mill about outside and, you know, in between classes and talk and bond and that kind of thing. But yeah, and we learned, you know, we had training, Spanish training, every morning.\n\nI remember I was in a training group with two other people with similar language skills. So we were like in an intermediate group and they had different groups set up based on your language training, you know, the language skill coming in. And I just remember really bonding with those folks as well. And language training being really tough because we had Ecuadorian Spanish speaking professors who did not really speak English or didn't speak a lot of English. And so they pretty much taught us completely in Spanish, which is, you know, very different than how most of us learned in the States where you can't really ask the question in English if you don't understand what they're saying. And so really, having to rely on your fellow volunteers, like what did she say or what did she mean or does anyone get this, you know? I'm confused. So I mean, that was fun.\n\nAnd then in the afternoon, we spent time doing more technical training, learning about different environmental education curricula, actually physically going out and identifying tree species and learning the trees of Ecuador, which was quite a task. Learning different, you know, agricultural techniques, you know, learning how to set up compost piles and different things like that. So we did do a lot of that type of training as well as the cultural, cross-cultural training as well. But it was a fun time, but we all lived with families in the same little village, and some of us had better families than others. I had an interesting family that the woman, it was a woman and she had two small children and she was very pregnant when I went there. And her husband was actually in the Oriente, was in the jungle, working in the oil fields, which a lot of men did do at the time, you know, to make money. So he wasn't really around. And it was difficult.\n\nShe was really, you know, we were very busy and we were traveling a lot throughout even different parts of Ecuador during our training, our technical training and also, you know, we had site visits during training. And so I wasn't home a lot and they were supposed to help us cook and clean. And, you know, it was very difficult because she was very pregnant. So I remember, you know, like coming home after a full day's of training and really trying to help her around the house. And wash all my laundry and, you know, but I mean, it was fine. They were a great family. We had other friends in training that, you know. It was a very interesting town being on the outskirts of Quito, where some people stayed with very affluent families and some people stayed with very poor families. So it was kind of a beginning of, I guess, training as far as culturally how things were in Ecuador, where there's some people who are very well off and some people, most people who are not. But it was, you know, it was a very, you know, I stayed in a little room that had a curtain that separated me from some of the other kids and, you know, concrete floor and very meager house that, you know, was not a whole lot different than probably my parents' garage, to be honest.\n\nSo it was a, you know, and a lot of us got sick. I was sick several times in training, just really bad dysentery and intestinal issues, mostly, and I think as most of us were. And you know, you get all these shots. I think we had 17 shots or something, some amazing a number of shots. Maybe I'm just imagining there were more than there were, but you know, a lot of the shots made you not feel so well. I remember yellow fever in particular. It was not very fun, but you know, it's also being sick and being in a foreign environment with a foreign family is not, you know, the best thing in the world. But I mean, it's tough. Training, I think, is, you know, despite the great fun that you have meeting the other volunteers and going out after training and wandering through the village and learning about, you know, new things and new products and new foods. I mean, you know, there's also the whole, you know, it's very stressful kind of being with the family and not communicating perfectly and going through all that was a very stressful time."

And I mean, a lot of the technical training was useful, especially that, you know, in my work, the tree identification, you know, the more kind of, you know, nuts and bolts of the technical things that we learned were definitely useful. Because, you know, the trees and vegetation of Ecuador are very different than trees that I had learned, you know, growing up in Illinois. So there, it definitely was useful. However, I think nothing can fully prepare you for when they drop you off at the site in the middle of nowhere and, you know, you have to kind of get things done. So I mean, I think the training definitely helped prepare, but I mean, most, you know, I think most of the preparation really happens once your feet hit your site."

And wow, I mean, I remember driving there at night and not being fully aware of where they were taking me. And, you know, ending up in this site the first night where I didn't have a house yet or anything. I was basically staying in a bunkhouse room that was, that had other people from my agency that used to bunk out there when they happened to be in town. But being dropped off in this room in the middle of nowhere after a very long drive, you know, 10, 11 hours in a car. And you know, my site had no electricity, and running water sometimes."

And several of the extension workers, there were two people in particular named Mary and Luis, who lived five hours away from the town I was situated in, but often went into my town to do educational work, mostly.\n\nSo they were kind of like my contacts and had dropped me off one night at this town but had to go somewhere else. And so I was really dropped off by myself in a very strange place with no electricity and a candle and a match. And it was very, uh, the reality set in pretty quickly what I had gotten myself into. But and then there was a local family they introduced me to who was the, you know, people who are kind of supposed to support me in my town and they really became my, you know, my family when I was there."

They would kind of come in and drop off supplies and drink a few nights and then be, you know, head out. So we, you know, we got to. The first night they took us in one of the agency trucks. But in general, it was bus. You know, bus in my town was about five hours west of the nearest major town called Tulcan, which is a provincial capital that's just on the border of Ecuador and Colombia. And I was about five hours in a bus, you know, west of that. And when I say, you know, and this is one of these, you know, one of these roads. I mean, Tulcan is a very high city, and I think we had to even go over a peak that was close to eleven thousand feet and then head all the way down to my town, which was at about, you know, I don't know, probably eight hundred feet.\n\nAnd so it was a very long, precipitous road where you look off to the, you know, the side of the bus and see nothing but air. You know, steep plunges to nothingness and just very perilous road, you know, snaking through the Andes, really, and then coming down into this kind of subtropical area. So it was always an experience. And, you know, it's one of those things where you never get completely comfortable with the bus ride because it was a scary, scary bus ride. But you know, you get used to it. And I'd had a few people come visit me from my family and, you know, put them on this bus and they were petrified for pretty much the whole ride. But it was, yeah, it was a beautiful, gorgeous place where I lived. I was very lucky. Just so green. I mean, green is the first word that pops in your mind, but just green and lush and tropical plants. And you know, a little town that's kind of bursting up out of out of, you know, essentially, you know, I wouldn't necessarily say jungle, but pretty close."

        "utterance": "You know, I didn't necessarily have regular hours. The hours were really dictated by, you know, often the bus. Because we have, the way where we lived, there was one bus a day, so there was one bus that left my site very early in the morning that would go to Tulcan, which was the nearby capital. And then that would leave late in the afternoon in Tulcan and kind of come back. And so often some of the towns that I worked in, I was required to jump on the bus in the morning to kind of drive up to one of the towns and then had to wait sometimes till, you know, pretty late in the afternoon to catch the bus to come back. And often that bus sometimes would not show up because there would be landslides. And so you'd have to just stay with whatever family next to the road would take you in. But you know, a lot of my schedule really revolved around the busses, although I did work in two other towns that I could hike to. And so those I generally tried to get to the town by a certain hour. But it was, you know, a lot of travel time generally during the day to go visit some place and then a few hours of either teaching or direct working with a group.\n\nAnd we did, I did mainly a few different types of things. We worked a lot with schools. We worked with about four or five different schools, you know, planting trees, trying to teach the kids about, you know, trees and how important they were. In our area there was a lot of logging of cedar and mahogany. And so we were trying to replant a lot of those tree species and also just planting vegetables. A lot of these kids in the schools that, you know, they got free rice and beans from the government, but just ate pretty much rice and beans every day and really poor diets. And, you know, based on altitude whether they were further up, they ate a lot of potatoes. And then some of my other towns were very tropical where they ate, you know, heavy bananas. And that was the amazing thing, even within a four or five hour radius of where I lived, I mean, altitude wise and, you know, what people were eating very pretty dramatically. And so we, you know, we did."

        "utterance": "Well, interestingly, I mean, they would because people would come down to get the bananas, to bring them up to the capital to sell them. And then they would take the kind of potatoes and carrots from the capital, which was in the higher altitudes, and take that down to our town. So you would get stuff kind of going back and forth. But for the most part, people ate. A lot of these people are very poor and essentially just ate whatever they could grow in the back of their house. But the kids in particular, a lot of the schools we worked with, the kids just ate very poorly. So we did little organic gardens and we tried to teach them how to plant different types of vegetables and eat a variety of things. And, you know, taught them a lot about biology, about plants and insects and pollination and stuff as well.\n\nAnd then we also did, I worked with five different, they were called integral farm projects, which were interesting. But they were actually funded, I think they were paid for by the Belgian government. I'm not exactly sure how that all happened, but the Belgians paid for these projects and they worked in several different towns and basically did a variety of different things. Worked kind of with cooperatives in different communities to do. We planted a lot of trees. We also planted nitrogen fixing trees that could self-fertilize crops. If you planted, you know, mixed a row of nitrogen fixing trees with crops, the nitrogen fixing trees would provide the nitrogen to the corn, for example.\n\nWe also did, you know, pig farms and whereby under this program, each one of these cooperatives would get like five pigs to start out with and then would be able to start selling the pigs at some point and taking them back to their own houses. We did guinea pig raising. They also got 10 guinea pigs when we first started and they were able to raise guinea pigs. In some of our communities, we did either trout farms or tilapia farms based on altitude and worked with different cooperatives on that as being part of the project. And then also really trying to take the waste from some of the farm fields, and, you know, and using that to help feed some of the some of the animals. And kind of working on this holistic farm project, which, you know, ended up being, you know, very interesting because you get into all the community dynamics of, you know, equity and whether or not people were spending the same amount of time working on the farm project and whether some people were giving really high nutritious food to the pigs and others were giving dirty rice water, you know, and kind of the feuds that would ensue based on that.\n\nBut you know, it was very interesting. And my days really varied quite a bit based on where I was. But, you know, essentially trying to get people to, you know, to plant vegetation, to try to supplement their diets with different types of vegetables and also meat, trying to produce some meat for them. Just trying to do a lot of different educational topics on safe pesticide application. Things like DDT, which are not allowed here in the U.S. anymore, are freely sold in Ecuador, in other countries and people are using them without any safety precautions, you know. And teaching them about, you end up doing latrines because it's, you know, you realize that everyone, these pigs are out and a lot of people. Our pigs were confined in chancheras, we called them, but in little, you know, structures to raise the pigs. But a lot of people just have their pigs, they eat whatever, and they don't really have sanitation and you get a lot of disease and you know, a lot of issues going on. So trying to educate people about properly disposing of their human waste, which became and ended up becoming a decent project for us, which wasn't originally planned.\n\nAnd, you know, just in working with different communities and responding a little bit to their needs too. And we had one community we worked in that was kind of interesting where we had horrible landslides all the time and a lot of the lower communities couldn't get their crops out. You know, it was mostly bananas and mangos and, you know, some pineapples and heart of palm and different things that we had. But they rotted really quickly. And if you had a landslide, you couldn't ship that stuff out and sell it. So people were losing a lot of money. And so we had a group of women that wanted to start a marmalade making business. And so one of the things that we did, which probably ended up being one of my most successful projects, was, you know, doing a little fundraising to support this marmalade project and getting these women equipment, you know, basically stoves and pots and pectin and different things that they needed to make marmalade. And, you know, getting them, you know, essentially starting a small business so that they could kind of capitalize from this unbelievable amount of fruit that they had.\n\nAnd even bananas, I mean, there's so many, we had so many bananas and different fruit that they couldn't even sell because everyone else has bananas in the town. So nobody wants to buy bananas. And if the trucks aren't coming, then you can't take the fruit and send it up to the Andes where people would buy that kind of thing. So just trying to kind of, you know, provide them with another way to make some money and to preserve the fruit that was rotting a lot of the times because the road was bad and we had a lot of rain, you know, daily. So there was always landslides and things, and trying to make sure that people had another outlet to do something with their product."

        "utterance": "So I would say both. I mean, in some cases, like, for example, with the marmalade, they were very receptive because it was their idea and they just needed a little bit of help, you know? And in other things, you know, they weren't so receptive. Like the latrines, for example, someone had come in before we were even there. And a lot of these people had latrines, the actual bowls, the porcelain bowls, that they had, you know, impatiens and different flowers growing out of because they never really made the latrine. And, you know, just kind of trying to educate people that it's much more safe for their family and their health to have a latrine. A lot of people were very resistant to that, and I remember a bunch of our, at the schools we were just trying to create latrines at the school so that the kids wouldn't have to run out everywhere and go to the bathroom. And you know, we worked with a lot of families where they harvested cedar and mahogany and other trees. And we said, well, each family needs to bring one board so we can build these latrines, you know, so we can build a latrine for the school. And, you know, having a really hard time, nobody, you know, I mean, it happens here too. I work a lot with communities here, but you know, having to go door to door and say, you didn't bring your board, I need your board, you know? And just trying to get those little things changed, like the personal habits changed, is incredibly difficult."

        "utterance": "Yeah, I mean, we actually, some of them there, we actually had bowls that someone had donated, and I'm not even sure who had donated them at one point, it could have been the government, but nobody had really built. They had bowls that, a lot of the schools had received these porcelain latrine bowls, but they never went that next step to make the latrines. So we essentially made the little hut, you know, and then dug the hole and put the actual porcelain bowls in place. So essentially, all of it is just going into a pit in the ground, but it's a little bit nicer. And it has this bowl where you can take rainwater, which was abundant, and river water and, you know, just flush the bowl after you go to the bathroom. So it's kind of more of a high tech latrine, if you will. But you know, that was very difficult. And even after we did end up building many of them, trying to make sure that they used them, you know, was very difficult.\n\nAnd, you know, just trying to change the agricultural practices to minimize erosion. You know, at the time, people always would plant their pineapples straight down the hill. And so when you have rain events, you have a lot of dirt and stuff washing off and they were losing a lot of topsoil. So we were trying to, you know, essentially educate them about terracing and the importance of growing the crops, you know, perpendicular to the slope so that you minimize erosion. And you know, a lot of it, things have just been done forever.\n\nAnd one of the other interesting things that I remember is we had people there, you know, a lot of them are tribal. We worked with mostly they're called mestizo, but they're mixed between indigenous and Spanish blood. But we also worked with a group of natives called the Awá and another group called the Chachis that both had their own culture and languages. And you know, many of the people that we worked with were, you know, had different tribal beliefs. And so that was always very interesting. You know, there were some of the tribal people that. We had a reserve next to us that was an anthropological reserve called the Reserva Awá, which was for the Awá people. And many of them were very much wanted nothing to do with me. They thought I was kind of the white devil. You know, they grabbed their children and run away from me when I first met them.\n\nBut I mean, you know, sometimes we'd walk really far to certain towns to work with people and, you know, to help them plant a garden or plant some trees or whatever it happened to be that day. And you know, a lot of times you'd get there and they would say, oh, we're not working today. And you'd say, well, why aren't you working today? And they'd say, oh, mala luna, which means, you know, bad moon. And you know, we never, you know, the moon is really bad right now. We can't, it's not a good time to plant or it's not a good time to weed or, you know, whatever it happened to be. And so that was very interesting and trying to be, you know, to learn those things. But often, you know, it didn't seem like there was rhyme or reason too, things would just change for no apparent reason. But you know, we, and a lot of the work and the walking around and, I mean, a lot of my sites would take, you know, all day to travel to or to walk to. And so you did become, you bonded a lot with.\n\nI had another local girl called Marlany, who was also employed by the agency I worked for, who was kind of like my host counterpart in the community. And we just spent a lot of time together, you know, in transport and kind of working, but also just having fun and talking and being together, you know, on the way to do work. And she also, her and her family became, I guess, one of my really, you know, my family really, my support in my community. So, you know, even the fact that we, you know, we worked quite a bit, I think, and especially in comparison to other volunteers I've talked to, I feel like we worked quite a bit. And, you know, I had my own tree nursery in the backyard and, you know, I'm kind of a, need to be doing a lot of things at one time. So I mean, you know, we worked a lot, even when I was home, I was planting trees and things for communities that I was working with.\n\nBut you know, we did spend a lot of time, I mean, you just spend a lot of time cooking and a lot of time cleaning and, you know, washing dishes and washing clothes by hand. We had what's called a pila. So when it rained or when we had drinking water, which was pretty rare. And it's interesting because I lived in a place where we had rain every day and it was kind of the opposite scenario that many people would think of, because you'd think if you had a lot of rain, you'd have fresh water all the time. But our town did have like a system of pipes to many of the, you know, the houses that carried water. But when it rained a lot, the pipes would get clogged up with leaves and dirt because the water was coming right from the river. And, you know, so when it was raining a lot, we wouldn't have water to the houses because the pipes, you couldn't keep them clean. And it seems like they would, someone would go out and clean the pipes or fix whatever problem happened, to fix what happened that day or whatever. And then you'd have running water maybe for a day and then you wouldn't have running water again.\n\nSo I would say, like, you know, 20 percent of the time we had running water, and when we did have that, you'd fill up every single bucket in your house, every single. You know, we had these concrete tanks in the back yard that we'd fill up with water just so you had water just to wash dishes and to wash clothes and things like that. Otherwise you're, you know, you're taking everything to the river. And the rivers, because we had so much rain were generally not, you know, sometimes they were clean, but most of the time they were pretty, you know, chocolaty brown looking. So we, you know, we had a lot of huge, you know, landslides were pretty common. We even had a really horrible one once where it took away like a town, like I think like a dozen people lost their lives. And I mean, they were washed away with livestock and everything down the river. I mean, it was unreal. So, you know, we really spent a lot of time just doing the day to day things because we didn't have electricity. You don't have refrigeration. So just the amount of time cooking was considerable. We would make a ton of soup. People in my town ate soup like crazy. And I think part of it was, you know, you can make a big vat of it and to the extent that you can heat it up, and most of us had gas stoves."

And if there wasn't any water in that, then it's down to the river essentially to get the water. But I made sure that I went out and bought a bunch of garbage cans with taps right when I got there. And just every time we happened to have water, just filled up every possible thing in my house I could fill up with water. So for cooking, that would be for cooking, for cleaning clothes, for everything. And you know, we had, Ecuador, I think out of all Peace Corps countries at the time was either number one or number two for intestinal illnesses. We were number one but, uh, or number two, but we had a lot of. You know, it wasn't uncommon for me to get dysentery or giardia. I'd say every couple of months I was having something going on.

And a lot of times, like with my job in particular, a lot of volunteers, I think, are very stationary. I tended to move a lot in the communities and sometimes even having to spend the night with different families. So, you know, a lot of times you ask people, is this water boiled? And they'd say, oh yeah, see? And it wasn't, you know. You'd get like a freezing cold like pineapple juice or something from someone which just looked like the best thing possible in the world that you could drink at that time. But you know that if anything was freezing cold, it essentially was right from the river because we didn't have refrigeration. So, you know, I think a lot of times too, you don't want to offend people by not eating their food or eating what the juice or drinking the juice that they provide for you. So and in fact, you know, if you go to certain places and they provided you with food and you didn't eat it, the next time you'd go by through there they wouldn't give you anything. So, I mean, you definitely did have to respect people.\n\nAnd that meant, I mean, at least in my case, I got sick quite a bit, I think, because I didn't always have one hundred percent control of what I ate and what I was drinking. And then sometimes people, you know, they're very poor. And I mean, I'd go to work with people and after we'd work with them all day, you know, helping them plant trees or, you know, work in their nurseries or whatever we were doing. You know, you'd come back and they'd give you like a meal of rice and pasta, which was like the only thing they had at that time because they didn't have any crops to share with you or any food. And I mean, some of these people were incredibly malnourished. And, you know, but others lived in, especially in the more tropical regions, could live, really could live on bananas and plantains. We had like five different kinds of bananas and yucca. You know, even though they were really poor as well, I think the communities I worked with in the more tropical areas ate much better in general than some of the Andean, the higher Andean communities where we worked, where it was really cold and difficult to produce, you know. So they had to buy a lot more like food, you know, than maybe some other people did.\n\nAnd I mean, I worked with people too that just hunted. But I mean, I lived with wonderful people in my town and they really, I think, several families in particular really took care of me and watched over me. And even towns, you know, in different places where I worked, I became really good friends with the teachers there and, you know, some of the families there that would put me up at different times. Just wonderful, wonderful people in general. But we spent so much time cooking together and cleaning and knitting and just hanging out with each other. And that was something that was really wonderful because I think in the U.S. a lot, you know, where I live in Milwaukee, I maybe know two or three of my neighbors. And you know, you live in a small town in Ecuador and you know everyone and everyone knows you, which is a good and a bad thing. We used to say \"pequeño pueblo, infierno grande,\" which means small town, big hell, which was true.\n\nThere was, you know, you don't have TV or entertainment. So, you know, people create entertainment by fabricating stories, you know? Why was the gringa in the store for ten minutes? You know, what was she doing in there? You know, buying eggs, you know, buying food. But people would, you know, create little intrigues about whether or not I was having an affair with a store owner at the time. But you know, that was really fun. And we used, when we I remember when we first started getting busses that came in that had TVs in them, which was, you know, pretty high end for my town. And just everybody in the town piling into the bus and watching movies at night because there was nothing to do. I mean, we didn't have power, we didn't have TV. You know, a lot of us had radios."

        "utterance": "Yeah, I mean, definitely things always get easier the longer you are somewhere and you get a lot more respect. I had kind of an interesting situation in that I was evacuated because there was fairly heavy guerrilla activity. And guerrilla, guerrilla activity I should say, of some Colombian groups. One, we didn't really have FARC, which is the one that most people hear about, wasn't super involved in our area, but we had a group called the Frente Comuneros del Sur that was kind of like a, you know, a little guerrilla group and they, you know, they had been in the area forever. And on the Colombian border and Ecuadorian border, there is a lot of, you know, I wouldn't say there's a lot of drug running, but there's certainly, you know, people. The borders are fairly porous and people going back and forth. And where I lived actually the only main road along the border was on the Ecuadorian side.\n\nAnd you know, it was pretty common to see these people every once in a while and you'd hear stories of young kids that kind of disappeared over the night that were, you know, left to join the guerrilla groups and would never be heard from again. Because, you know, there's at least the rumor, and I'm probably true that, you know, they couldn't really leave once they joined. And so and you'd hear stories of them coming into town and bribing store owners and making sure that the store owners would give them blankets or give them food or whatever. But we had a couple of instances where there was holdups of busses that were the route I was mentioning before from the capital down to my site. And it's fairly easy to hold up a bus when you have a precipitous decline of death on one side of the bus. You just put a couple of rocks in the road and the bus has to stop. There's nowhere for the bus to go. So there were some people that were holding up busses with guns and stealing money and things like that.\n\nAnd nothing ever happened to me, thank goodness, but the word kind of trickled down to Quito that this stuff had been happening. Although I would add that it happens pretty much all over the country, but in particular because I was so close to Colombia, I think, and the State Department had some sort of information that they were uncomfortable with me being there. So my last year was, or a little bit less than my last year, was a little traumatic in that I was taken out of my site and still ended up working with the same agency and essentially applying my skills on more of a regional level in the northern portion of Ecuador and working with some other communities that my agency worked with. But that was very hard because, you know, you become really close with the family and friends that you have in your town and having to leave them was very traumatizing. And also the way, I was pretty much having, I had to leave pretty quickly and precipitously. Essentially had the white jeep show up in front of my house and had to pack up and leave and wasn't able to really say goodbye to a lot of people. And not really, technically, you know, wasn't really allowed to go back.\n\nAlthough I did end up meeting a lot of my friends in the capital and meeting up with them from time to time in the nearby capital, where we had to go to get mail and to get, you know, really a lot of food and money from the bank, you know? And so I would be able to meet up with them in Tulcan, which was the nearby provincial capital. But my last year was a little, a little difficult, and just kind of making a transition and kind of, you know, doing a lot of almost I don't know if I'd call it consulting work, but kind of doing some of the work I had been doing in my site and bringing it to some other communities. And in some cases got to visit some other volunteer friends and kind of do little charlas on fruit tree grafting and, you know, did marmalade demonstrations in several different communities and teaching people how to make marmalade and jams."

I mean, well, I would say here we think of marmalade as orange marmalade, but there in Spanish they call them mermeladas, is pretty much kind of the, I guess the catchall word for all kind of fruit preserves and jams and things like that. So I ended up doing kind of a lot of different things toward my last year that I was there. So things changed a lot. But you know, you obviously, you get more skills, you get more, you have more confidence in your skills and more confidence certainly in language. So that, you know, in many ways, it was kind of fun because you can go out and I felt like I was, you know, much more effective certainly in my final year.\n\nAnd was able to take some really wonderful vacations with friends. I mean, a bunch of volunteers went to the Amazon and did a really great trip and a bunch of us went to the beach once too and met up, I think, during the holidays and had a really nice trip. So I was a little bit, I mean, I was fairly isolated in that I was, you know, a good distance from the provincial capital and my closest volunteer was probably only 25 miles away, but it took about seven hours to get to him. So I, you know, I think as opposed to a lot of other volunteers, bonded a lot with the community and my Ecuadorian friends, probably more so than some of my other volunteers just because, you know, I didn't live close to a lot of other Peace Corps volunteers."

But you know, and I didn't necessarily want to be maybe as isolated as I was, but I certainly did enjoy it. And I think it helped me definitely with my language skills, and I think it really was great for my overall experience that I really was able to bond with the locals more than I probably would have if I had been closer to other volunteers."

And they're like these big gas tanks that kind of, you know, were very heavy, but I mean, they're essentially propane gas like almost like a camping stove really. But this is what people cook on all the time. However, while we were there and kind of, it was more toward the end of my service, the Ecuadorian economy really started tanking and the sucre, which was the local currency, lost like 85 percent of its value. And it always used to be that, you know, Ecuadorians would go into Colombia to buy cheap stuff, and it kind of switched where all the Colombians would start coming into Ecuador because everything had lost so much value. Or actually, I think actually I'm getting that twisted around. But anyway, it was, I'm getting it a little bit twisted, but it was cheaper to go and get gas in Colombia for a while.\n\nSo a lot of us were heading up to Colombia to get our gas because the Ecuadorian gas just became really expensive or the money wasn't worth much anymore, so it was harder and harder to buy it. So a lot of people are going into Colombia, and a lot of people started just cooking with wood, which became a problem because, you know, people cook with wood full fires in their houses, which mostly are just, you know, wood planks and tin roofs. But you still, some of the air quality in some of these people's homes. You walk into these little huts and, you know, fill up your lungs with smoke. And so a lot of people started cutting down a lot of trees at that time, which was upsetting because we were trying to, you know, replant them."

And ultimately, Ecuador ended up switching to the dollar, to the U.S. dollar, because their currency completely lost its value. And that didn't happen till after I left, but it was fairly close after I left. And that, you know, from what I heard from my friends who I'm still in touch with, has been really difficult for the Ecuadorian people because, you know, you know, things got more expensive because you're paying more dollar prices for a lot of things. And I'm no economist and I don't completely understand it but it was, yeah, it was an interesting time period, for sure."

You know, but I would never give it up. And I mean, we always tell people, you know, it's the toughest job you'll ever love, but it's true. It was very tough. But at the same time, I met wonderful Ecuadorian people, some of whom I still try to stay in touch with, and wonderful other friends too that were Peace Corps volunteers that will be lifelong friends. And you know, you just. And just being able to bond with other people who had that same experience is pretty, pretty special. And, you know, I loved it. I mean, it was, uh. I think we achieved a lot, you know, hopefully a lot of people will remember me and remember what we tried to do, and will do things a little bit differently in the future. And I think, you know, from a technical perspective, we were pretty successful.\n\nI haven't been back. And I really would love to go back, but I'm also a little scared to go back to see how things maybe have ended up. But you know, from what I hear and I still get calls probably a couple of times a year from some friends when they happen to get into town and can find a, you know, a phone or can afford to pay to call me, that, you know, things are going pretty well. Like I know my cooperative of women with the mermeladas are doing really well, and they've gotten their formal like sanitary registries from the government and can sell their marmalade slash jam, you know, wherever they want to now. And so I know some of the projects are going really well and that makes me feel really good. But you know, I still have friends too calling me, asking me for money, which is always a tough one. And really just trying to support them and let them know that they need to, they need to be, you know, they need to work this out for themselves. And normally they do, you know, you just really need to push them and they'll come up with a solution themselves. But it's something I never would regret and something I definitely would do again.\n\nAnd I did end up joining Crisis Corps after grad school just briefly, and I won't get into it, but in Honduras after Hurricane Mitch, and that was something that was also a very interesting experience. And subsequently as well, I'm very involved with the Milwaukee Peace Corps Association and we just are really a group that can support people getting home from Peace Corps and having them find friends that understand what they've been through. Supporting and educating people who are leaving, you know, as well as just providing fun place for social activities for people to get together a few times a year. We have ethnic eats events and different community service events that we do as well, like river cleanups and different things. And we also, you know, raise money and try to give some of it back to current volunteers that need a little money for projects. So I mean, that's a, I really appreciate being involved in that group and, you know, just being able to kind of keep that tie with Peace Corps and supporting people, new people coming back. And, you know, every time they come back and tell you their stories, it kind of reminds you of your own and puts a smile on your face."

And it was always amazing to me that they could be so scared of a white person being that they didn't have TV or movies or even really radio where they lived and were incredibly isolated. Some of the people I worked with were a 10 to 15 hour walk from my town, which was already in the middle of nowhere. So very interesting. And a lot of people after they knew you, you know, over time knew that you were a good person. But you know, yeah, I mean, it was always hard battling those misconceptions and, you know, people thinking we wore our clothes once and threw them out. And, you know, having these crazy ideas of kind of what life was like in the United States, at least for me. And so, you know, I think a lot of people I worked with, I tried really hard to just let them know what our life was like. And you know, most people, you know, working class people in the U.S., how our lives are and how we're not all that dissimilar to them, but have different challenges really. And so I hope that I educated them a little bit about people in the U.S."

And I'm trying to provide technical support to different landowners about, you know, what they can do to improve the water quality of the river. Very similar to what I used to do in Ecuador, really. And, you know, trying to problem solve and come up with solutions and, you know, really working on a local community by community basis, which is really similar actually to what I did in Peace Corps.\n\nAnd a lot of the education type of work I do in my current profession, you know, you know, instead of, you know, meeting with a small group of Ecuadorians in a school, it's meeting with, you know, village common council or meeting with, you know, interested people who are interested in the environment.

It started, they started building the infrastructure right at the end of my service but were having a very hard time with it because they were using hydropower and had a tremendous amount of energy, and not enough places to send the energy, because there weren't that many people living in the area. And we lived next to this Rio San Juan, which was a raging river that separates Colombia and Ecuador. And so my understanding is that they do have electricity now, but I think they still, you know, it's not, it kind of comes and goes, because I think they've been having trouble with the system. But yeah, and I'm sure it's changed quite a bit, actually. And that's why I'm very curious and I'm also kind of trepidatious about returning and seeing how things have changed. But I know that they still don't have."

      "description": "Mary Quattro served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Malaysia from August 1968 to November 1970 as a secondary education teacher. She was born and raised in a small rural community in West Virginia with a large immigrant population. She joined after completing a degree in education, and her pre-service training in Hawaii covered the Bahasa Melayu language, teaching techniques, and Malaysian culture. At the time, Malaysia was a newly independent country and welcomed Peace Corps support in various areas, especially education. Quattro boarded at her school in Lundu, East Malaysia, alongside a diverse group of students and teachers. She taught taught English as well as Malaysian history, and managed the school's library. While she loved her project in general, she felt the Peace Corps failed her in not dealing with a stalker, which forced her to leave service two months early. The experience changed how she saw the world and helped develop her self-confidence. Interviewed and recorded by Randolph Adams, December 9, 2019. 2 digital audio files (web streaming files combined into 1 file).",

And, uh, so I didn't hear much of a West Virginia accent. I heard European accents. Uh, my, uh, father was first generation, and my grandmother and her and my granddad were, had come over and started a family here. Um, I think one of the things originally that, uh, I heard about, uh. Uh, it was a very small town, so we didn't have a lot of, of outside influence. But I always understood that about a broader world and wanted to be able to see that.\n\nAnd one of the first things that I wanted to do was when I went on to college, and I was the, the first in my family to actually get a college degree. But when I went on to college, I had heard about, um, VISTA volunteers, uh, which were in the Appalachian regions, most of them. And I wanted to do that, but I wasn't accepted into, uh, VISTA volunteers, and I was, not until later anyway. At first I wasn't accepted there, and I was really upset about that. And Peace Corps had just been, I think Peace Corps was in the early, about '64 started?"

So I was very hopeful that that would be a possibility for me, to go to the Peace Corps. Um, I liked the whole idea of, of having it, like, you know, of course, John Kennedy was an inspiration to everyone.\n\nUm, but my family was not excited about me leaving, so, um, I didn't tell them about it until, I didn't tell them I had taken the test. I didn't tell them that I'd been accepted until it was getting down to the wire, and I needed to do things like, um, get my shots and get my, uh, tickets and get ready to, to leave. Um, I think they were just afraid for me, and they didn't want me to go. Um, my mother had lived all her life within 20 miles of where she was born, as had my dad. So it was, uh, it was a daunting prospect. We might need to stop just a second."

But it was, I think it was a big stretch for them to have me go.\n\nUm, so I left out of a little tiny airport in Elkins, West Virginia. Had got on like a little honest to God prop plane almost, and flew up to, uh, Pittsburgh airport and left out of, out of Pittsburgh. And my dad took me over to the airport. But he was, he was very sad to do that. Um. So I, and that was the first time I'd ever flown. So I flew from, uh, from Pittsburgh to, out to California.

And so I can remember one of the things that once we got in country that they did, that you could go on the radio and they would have this class every day. It was called, and it was the Malaysian government doing it. And they would say, learn a word a day, and then they would tell you the Malay word and the English word so you could learn it. But Malaysia itself was still in transition because it was brand new. It was a brand new country.\n\nAnd, uh, you know, we were invited there to help develop their education system and some of their, their rural, rural schools. Um. Many, many people spoke English, though, and spoke English well, because, again, it had been a British protectorate for 100 years. And so they, their English was in most cases excellent. So. We had Chinese language. Some, some people took Chinese language courses. I did not. Some took it because they knew they would be living in, uh, took Mandarin because they'd be teaching more in those areas. Uh, the area that I was in was in, uh, more of a, uh, what they call Bahasa, was a, uh, a local, local dialects rather than. So, again, people were speaking different languages.

I mean, they were, they were uh, uh, Muslim, but they were not strict Muslim. I mean, they weren't Muslim, fundamentalist Muslim in the way they are now, like they did not wear the, didn't cover their heads. In fact, most of the Malay women wore beautiful saris. And, you know, over at the time after we left and after the Iranian revolution, then they started taking on the, the hijab and all that.

It wasn't unusual to, if you were on the bus, to have a, like a sewing machine that was going up and down the aisle because nobody was attached to it. It was just being sent to somebody. Um. Or to have animals on the bus.\n\nAnd of course, and everybody along the road, they just stopped and they'd hailed the bus and you'd get on, and then you'd get off at the next little post in the jungle somewhere, and that's the way that went.

And the school was, uh, I'd say probably a mile or two from the bazaar.\n\nUm, I had a nice little, little place in my own little, um, quarters. There were three, three in a row. And that's where the teachers, uh, lived. And there were two Malay teachers who lived on either side of me, two men. Um, it was very much a British setup of how the school was built and operated. But we had, uh, three forms of students, um, and they were learning English, obviously. So I taught English as a second language, but I also, which always amused me, taught Malaysian, Malaysian history, uh, which I'd have to learn the night before because I didn't know it. But I learned a lot of the past history because, as I say, Malaysia was a new country. So it was interesting to go back to the time of the Raj and also hear, you know, update it to, to the current, uh, time.\n\nAnd while I was there, um, there was still, uh, a lot of, uh, fighting going on, and we were several times put on alert that we might have to vacate because there were Indonesian. Malaysia in Borneo is right on the border of, of, uh, Indonesia. And so very often Indonesian rebels would come over into the side of, uh, across the border. Uh, I honestly remember several times of, I would assume Malaysian rebels. Their bodies were brought down to the, to the padang, to the area to, like the. So I, you know, there was fighting going on and I was, I was right on the edge of the jungle.\n\nUm, there was a, uh, CUSO volunteer there, a Canadian volunteer who was there, and me. Um, and I was in charge of the girls dormitory, which was close to my house. It was just like, it was a short distance. So the I kind of was the house mother for them as well. So. But I think I, you know, we were, we were pretty much accepted.\n\nUm, I remember one time, um, somebody was missing, some child was missing, and so they tried to see if they could, I mean, people were searching for him, and they called in the, uh, Iban, uh, leaders. I don't want to, I don't exactly what they called them. Now I'm forgetting my words. But he was like the headman. And so to see if he could find, you know, kind of discern where he was from, where the child was or what had happened, if the hantus had taken him, the spirits had taken him, or if he was hurt or whatever. And then they did that the same thing with one of the Malay cikgus.\n\nSo then they decided, well, they'll just try me then and see if I could find where it is, because here's, you know, here's this American, maybe she's got something, some special magic that she can find. And I was thinking to myself then, I mean, I want this child to be found, but I hope to God I'm not the one that finds him, because then, then they'll think that I got, like, I'm a witch or something. Very much in that area, a lot of this whole idea of hantus, of ghosts, and, uh, and that kind of thing."

Um, I think it was pretty much a typical school day.\n\nI was also in charge of the library, and they didn't have much of a library. And I closed it down one time because I decided that we needed to catalog the books. Well, that was really one of the dumb things I did, because we didn't quite get that cataloged, and it had been closed for about a week or so. And I just remember my students were saying, miss, miss, you must open the library. We're just so sad. We need to be in there. All right. Let's, you know, and because they, they really, they were really good students, really, uh, you know.\n\nIt was funny. They, of course, spoke all kinds of languages. Most of the kids spoke three or four languages because of the Iban. And the Chinese students spoke two or three different dialects, you know, and, and the. And of course, many of them spoke English. Um. So they decided that I, you know, I was writing and speaking in English, but it was American English, so sometimes they weren't sure it was exactly right. Um, and so I said, okay, well, I can't write in, in Jawi script or anything, but I, here's, I'll teach you this. So I taught them how to do shorthand. So it tickles me that somewhere somebody could write in shorthand, I'm sure a script that nobody uses anywhere anymore in the world. But at the time, I could write in shorthand. So they thought that was interesting."

And you'd be in a room, you know, with a teacher's meeting, and there would be maybe four languages going on at one time. And they, and they would not necessarily be speaking Bahasa Melayu. They'd be speaking Chinese or, or in Malay dialect of some kind. So you'd sit in there and then everybody, everyone would throw out an English word for me, so I could kind of keep up with the, with the conversation. Uh, because they did not always speak in English.\n\nUm, so I, I, I think I learned a lot by that, by being the minority, because as a white woman, I was not used to being a minority. And it was a good experience for me to, to be that. I remember even coming back, uh. I was downtown, I was in Washington, and I was on an elevator, and I was speaking to another volunteer who was with me, and I was speaking in English to her. And I said to her, I'm not sure where we need to go next. And the person in the elevator said, well, I'll help you. And both of us went like this. We weren't used to being able to speak English and not have, and have someone understand us. So because we were just off the plane, we were like, okay, brand new.

Before I left, I would say for about six months before I left, um, I had a stalker. And he was persistent, to say the least. At first I couldn't quite figure out what was going on. I was like, what is it? My, we had the shutters on our windows, you know, like the wooden shutters. I'd wake up and my shutters would be open and I'd think, I'm sure I closed that. Um. Or I would go back to my house and something seemed odd. Uh, and I couldn't, I didn't know what was going on.\n\nOne weekend I went into town, into Kuching, and I was going the whole weekend. And I came back and my kids were so upset, my girls. And they, they had washed all my clothes and they were hanging them out on the line. And I was like, what happened, what, what? What's up kids? Oh, miss, miss, we're so sorry. So apparently this horse's rear had gotten into my house and had, you know, scattered the clothes everywhere. And the girls saw him. And so they were trying to clean them before I got back. And, um, this just went on, and I kept telling Peace Corps about this. And they kept saying, oh, no, no, we don't want to disturb any of the host country nationals. And I was like, okay then.\n\nThe first time then and then he, whoever this person was, and we never found out. Got into, was into, or we never tried to find out anything. **\n\nuh, got into my house, I went to the police, the local police, with my friend Don. He went with me. And the local police said, must be your friend. Must be some friend of yours. I said, no, no, no, no. So even then, they didn't believe women. You know, first of all, I was a single woman here by myself. They even asked me, or did your family? I mean, they, I guess they kind of assumed we must have been prostitutes or something. Why would single women be here, you know? So they were, I could tell, were going to be of zero help. Um, so, as I say, I reported to Peace Corps several, several times, went in town and reported it, and they kept telling me to put a lock on my door. Well, I, I did, but that didn't. I had several locks.\n\nSo one morning, um. No. Anyway, this went on. And one evening I was asleep and I woke up and he was in here, right in my face, just right here. And I can still hear the sound I made, which was furious. I was so damn mad. I was like, God knows what I called him, but it was mostly a sound. And I just, I guess I scared the hell out of him, which was fine, because he went out running. But I did too. And I ran after him and in the jungle, and I was, I was out in the jungle when it finally occurred to me that that probably wasn't a sensible thing to be doing. I'm barefooted and out in the jungle, you know.\n\nSo I went home, waited till it got light. Again reported it, and I think one time, one time, one of the, whoever was head, was head of the Peace Corps volunteers at that time in Kuching did come out and talk to the, um like the other teachers, the principal. I don't know if he talked to the policeman or not, but I could tell they weren't going to really do anything to help me. So, uh, one, one morning I was going to school. Had my cup of tea, locked all my doors, and spilled the hot tea down myself and couldn't get back. Couldn't get back in because I'd forgotten the key in there. So I thought, I think I'm going home. And, and I did. I decided, I went in and I told them, I need to go now because you're not going to help me.\n\nUm, and this, like I say, this had gone on for months, and it was unfortunate because I, for me, it was overall a good experience. The reason it wasn't so good, a good experience, is that Peace Corps did not support me. Uh, they didn't really try to help. And come to find out afterwards, there were a couple of, uh, women volunteers who had been posted at that same place. Same thing had happened to them. I didn't know that until, until much later. But Peace Corps knew it, and they should never have posted a person there, a woman there, but they did because they didn't want to upset the host country, as they said. And I thought, well, but I learned much later that that's what had happened. And then the one woman who, Joan, they're actually both of them were named Joan. But, but little Joan, little Joan had moved into town, uh, because that was happening. But.\n\nAnd Peace Corps knew that, they should have told me. But they didn't. They didn't. And they shouldn't have posted someone there. So that part for me was very unfortunate, because I would like to have stayed my whole time there. I had intended to stay the whole time. But my concern mostly, uh, at the end, was that my girls would be, um, hurt. You know, if this dumbass is going to come into my house, he's also going to come in to where those girls are. And so, uh, I, you know, and that's the reason I came home early. But Peace Corps failed, failed me on that. And I, I remember going to, uh, a couple of, uh, one, one year down on the Mall they had a, you know, a Peace Corps thing, you know, when they have 4th of July, they used to. And there was this whole group talking about, oh, Peace Corps, you know, we'd send our kids, we'd do this and that. And I'm like, well, no, that's not always the case.\n\nI mean, we had a volunteer killed while we were there. Uh, a volunteer died while we were there, there was in country. And I just think that that they, it wasn't until many years later, and I don't know if you probably know when, that they started finally funding, I mean, they're trying to really follow through on some of this stuff. There was this whole attitude about don't, don't rock the boat kind of stuff. And I think that was unfortunate. But, but I, you know, I didn't want, I was determined that that was not going to be my only Peace Corps experience. That was an experience and it was unfortunate. But that's not what defined my time there. And so when I, when I look back on it as overall it was positive for me.\n\nIt was very positive experience. It gave me the opportunity to travel. It certainly gave me the opportunity to meet other people. It gave me the opportunity to be a minority and to see how that feels. Uh, it gave me the opportunity to just have an experience that I never would have had in Davis, West Virginia. Uh, so I am, um, I'm grateful that I did that. And I think probably one, was one, I mean, I'm glad I went, and I think it was probably one of the bravest things I ever did, uh, to just decide that that's what I was going to do. And then, then it was also, um, I think, brave to say that I won't take any more of this. You know, I'm not going to just be this nice little kid here. A nice little Catholic school girl. This is not right. And you, you need to help protect me a little bit."

I had two principals, the Chinese principals. Uh, Sim was a wonderful young man. He was very young. And Mr. Wong, who was the but, but that's neither here nor there. But I mean, the teachers, most of them of us got along pretty well."

You were supposed to go in and dip the water and take your shower. Well, I didn't know that. I got in the cement thing. Well, I'll tell you, my roommate just, oh my God, she was horrified. She's like, what the hell is wrong with this woman? I'm sure she thought to herself. But I thought, it must be a shower. But it was awful, it was difficult to get into, but I thought, what do I know? So I'm in here ruining the whole water supply, you know, taking my shower. Like, no, no, let me explain. Just dip it. Okay. Splash and dip. Okay. Got it. So I only did that one time.\n\nUm, but, I mean, it was nice. We did have running water. I could cook if I wanted to, although God knows I didn't want to, but we had, like, you know, gas. Uh, I guess it was propane stoves and stuff. And toilets, which was very, very nice to have toilets."

But I think it was in what we did was say, this is how America looks. Um, because there was a war going on. There was, you know, we were in Vietnam and we were not telling the truth about what we were doing there. You know, we would listen to, uh, Armed Forces Radio and they'd say, well, we knew there were troops in country, for God's sake we could see them, you know? So, so, I think, uh, I mean, we just were not telling the truth.\n\nAnd I think, um, the fact that there was the insurrection that was going on with Indonesia, uh, we got, we learned, you know, I mean, there was, there was a lot of unsettled things. And somehow we were a little bit, there was some stability, but there was also a different face to us. We weren't necessarily all the people that were fighting all the time. We were trying to do something. And I know, I know my, like my girls, I mean, they were young girls. They were young, you know, ten, 12 years, 13 years old.

Why didn't somebody in the Peace Corps office say, well, then you come, come into town? But they didn't. They in fact said, put on more locks instead. And I think there was this, this kind of almost a disbelief. And I mean, that's crap. You don't send women out there. I don't think it would happen today. What I'm saying is, I don't think that attitude would be there today. But we're talking 50 years ago and women were not, I mean, we weren't treated as if we had any sense or we knew what was going on. And it surely must. Like the cop said, the local policeman, surely he must be your friend. No.\n\nBut I mean, there was that attitude too. Why would this single woman be out here in the jungle? Um, so I don't. I would hope that Peace Corps would have more sense today. I don't know that the other countries would, but, I mean, you need to be taken much more seriously in that. I could have been killed. And I didn't even know that. I didn't have enough sense to know that. I thought that I was just, I was just furious. I was just furious that somehow someone could be so intrusive to me."

We supplied the teaching, the teachers that they needed, because they were a developing country. Uh, we supplied. Uh, just, you know, we just supplied rural, rural development people. Um. We supplied engineers. I mean, I think that we were really helpful in nation building for them. And I don't know how many years we had volunteers in Malaysia. I would think maybe, maybe 15 may be the most. I wouldn't think more than that. We finally, I think kind of, I used to know that, but I don't know it now.\n\nBut I think we, we did work ourselves out of a job. We did help the, the overall development, um, of the country from. Because it was very new and, and they, they just didn't have, weren't able to do their, the services. They needed help and they were willing to take it. And they, they asked us and um, and then they asked us to leave. And so that worked out. That's the way that should have been too, when they felt they could take care of their own needs. Yeah. Because it wasn't, it wasn't our job to stay forever.\n\nAnd I would like to think that some, some old coot somewhere thinks, remembers, uh, U.S. citizens with kindness, rather than the face of what they see now sometimes. That they know everyone, uh, that the United States isn't always the face that it presents, uh, politically. And, you know."

I like, I worked at elections for years and years and just other things, you know, that I did that were related to that. I, uh, I actually helped to start the Friends of Malaysia. There are a couple, there were a couple of us that worked on it. But I came, I was cleaning out my basement the other day and came across a few things from when we first started that group, and then some other people have taken over, obviously.\n\nUh, because I didn't think, I didn't think it was up to us as Friends, as Friends of Malaysia, to always be. You were talking about the first group that kind of died out. See, I think you don't just keep saying what we did or how it was. And that's why I like the groups that I see, like the Wisconsin groups and others. What do you do now? Because that's bringing the world back home. You can't just be back in my day, you know, or back in the day. I mean, that's nice to reminisce about, but, uh. You know, a lot of our people went into, had contacts with through State Department and things like that. And I think that's what they were doing. You know, they were really bringing the world back home in their sense of somehow understanding that.\n\nWe had one volunteer, I don't think he ever did come home. He just stayed. There's one volunteer, I forget his name now, but there was one guy who just, he, he stayed. He never came back. He's like, no, I like this country. So."

And plus you get good food and, but it's, it's. I don't know that that we have any. I don't see that group, and maybe I'm wrong. I should not just condemn it like that. But I'm not convinced we've done any kind of, um, current thing as far as Malaysia is concerned. I mean, it's a different, it's a different country. It's got a different approach, uh, from the time we were there. It's become, uh, much more, uh, in some sense a fundamentalist country, which was not what we were. Uh, we weren't used to that. I mean, it was a different experience for us.\n\nBut I think it's, I think as a country and especially on the island of Borneo, uh, they have worked so hard, the natives, the, the bhumiputra, the sons of the soil, they work so hard to try and preserve the, the jungles and that. And we, we did, have contributed money and things. We've done some rural, uh, rural, uh, electric and water, uh, projects with, with other organizations. We've done some of that. But, but East Malaysia is still is much is, is behind the curve and in a way good. It's good for them. But they're also, their resources are being just, just diminished. Um."

You would remember when Lillian Carter went, remember? Miss Lillian went to serve in the Peace Corps. Um. I just think that it, it is a good, it's a good program. I think it's one of the most successful programs that the United States has had. And it's, it's, people don't realize how successful it can be one-to-one. Um, so I would encourage people to do it, but I also would encourage people, I would encourage Peace Corps to not be afraid to have some courage. Um. Not to just say, you know, we don't always have to be concerned about host country nationals. If there is something that's not, that needs to be corrected, we need to say that to, the volunteers need to say that to Peace Corps.\n\nUm. And I think we don't go with the idea that we're being benevolent, because what happens is we, as volunteers, I suspect, learn more and get more out of it than we give. And to me, that's critical right now in this, this climate that we're in, uh, that we don't become so insular and so isolated that we think we're the ones that know everything, because we don't know squat half the time. And just to be, uh, and I mean this sincerely, to be a minority absolutely changes your perspective, and I, I think we need it.\n\nAnd I think we also, you know, we don't, uh, I mean, it's got to affect our immigration policy. It's got to affect our social policies. I mean, we, we just, we don't have all the answers. And Peace Corps is a way of of contributing. But it's not to be arrogant. I don't think Peace Corps is arrogant, but I, what I'm saying is if you go, you go with a certain, uh, as a volunteer, you go with a certain amount of humility."

      "description": "David Fryar Arnold served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ethiopia from 1964 to 1966 as a secondary school teacher. As newlyweds, David and his wife Courtney trained at the University of California at Los Angeles where they studied Amharic, Ethiopian history and culture, teaching methods, and endured physical training and selection-related evaluations. After a brief orientation and an introduction to Ethiopian food in Addis Ababa, they traveled to their assigned village, Asebe Teferi, where they shared a house with two other volunteers. Their arrival allowed the school to offer 9th and then 10th grade classes; David taught 8th to 10th grade English, social studies, and math. In the interview, he describes the surrounding natural environment, riding in local buses, being required to take students to watch a public whipping, going on weekend camping trips with students, and difficulties learning the unspoken cultural differences between local Oromo and Amhara ethnic groups. Arnold relates numerous stories, including those of several students who made notable contributions and have resurfaced in his life. After the Peace Corps, he established a career in journalism and is now editor of WorldView, the quarterly magazine of the National Peace Corps Association. Interviewed and recorded by Patricia Wand, September 10, 2018. 2 digital audio files (web streaming files combined into 1 file).",

David served from June 1964 until June 1966 in the Ethiopia III group, which was an education group. First, David, thank you very much for agreeing to be interviewed. I think your story is extremely important, especially since frankly, you were part of a married couple that went to Ethiopia, and not very many volunteers in those days were married. But this interview is about you, and I'd like to start with the question why did you join the Peace Corps?"

        "utterance": "Well, first of all, thank you for inviting me to this. I realize how important it is to be able to get these stories down. Why I joined the Peace Corps. There are two names that come to mind. One is Sargent Shriver and the other is Joe Roberts. We all know who Sargent Shriver was. I was attending Washington University in St. Louis at the time and went to Graham Chapel and heard Sarge speak. I, frankly it's been so long ago, I don't remember what he said, but I was very impressed with the way he said it and the impact he had on the entire audience as well as myself. Joe Roberts was my father-in-law, and one time, well I think it was before we were engaged, Courtney and I were visiting his family and Joe said, had you ever thought about the Peace Corps? Well, we had.\n\nAnd when I did graduate from college undergraduate school, I was looking for a job and I went to New York and Washington, D.C., looking for publishing jobs in New York. Found that I couldn't afford New York, at least at the salaries they were willing to pay and the jobs which were simply selling paperback books up and down the East Coast for Scott Foresman or one of the other publishers. So I went to Washington and found the Peace Corps office, where we had applied more than a year before and had never heard anything. And so I went up to the counter and asked where our applications were, and the woman said, well, if you applied that long ago, let me look in the file. And so she came back and said, would you like to go to Ethiopia?\n\nAnd so I called Courtney and asked her if she were willing to go, and that would have been about a week following our planned wedding. And she said yes, and I said yes. And so three days after our wedding on June 20, we ended up in training at UCLA."

One of them tried to and ended up being a consultant in computer data processing they called it at the time. And I was the youngest of the three. A little more sensitive, a little more artistic, and not as good a student as my brothers. But then I went to University of Missouri for two years and then returned to St. Louis to go to Washington University and worked in a bookstore called the Book Nook. So I had a very middle class Midwest background for going to UCLA and then on to Ethiopia."

And while my two brothers were very, very young, she was doing quite a bit of art at home, had some exhibitions at the St. Louis Art Museum, along with other amateurs in the community. And throughout her life and later after my father died, she did pursue her art through a study group. She also taught later as a widow in high school."

        "utterance": "We had no idea what we were getting into. We took a night flight to Los Angeles and I remember the sun rising as we landed. And we have been on the plane with a gentleman, a scholar from somewhere in the East who bragged about his 40 cartons of research and books that he was transferring to a library at UCLA where he was going to be a guest speaker and professor. But when we got off the plane, we didn't know whether, when we found Westwood Village and found Hershey Hall the dormitory, we didn't know whether we'd be able to stay together, either in training or even in the Peace Corps. And so we made a pact that if we ever split up, we were going to quit.\n\nThe training was the third year that Peace Corps had training and it was still in the United States, which always has been a problem, and I very much appreciate the fact that pretty quickly Peace Corps discovered you better do the training in the country where they're going to serve. But we had about 25 or 30 Ethiopians, I think most of them were Amharas, who were giving language training, and there were several very renowned scholars, Wolf Leslau and an Ethiopian whose name I cannot recall right now, who was an anthropologist who ended up living in Eritrea, although I think he was born and raised in Ethiopia. The language training was difficult.\n\nCourtney and I did, in fact, get to sleep in the same room in the dormitory, along with 19 other married couples in a Peace Corps program of, I think it was about 300 trainees. And our room was on the second floor of Hershey Hall. The men, the other men were on the first floor of Hershey Hall and the women were on the third floor of Hershey Hall. And outside of our window was the fire escape. So we experienced a lot of traffic going up and down that fire escape in our own little dormitory room. The physical training was interesting. We had to tread water for a long time, which didn't prove difficult for anybody. We did a lot of running, which was good for all of us. I was able to do some track and field, which I've never done since then. The classes were amazing. We were learning so much about a place we knew nothing about, and some of the best scholars in the country were there to teach us."

But most of all, it was how to speak Amharic, which was the language of about 40 percent of Ethiopia, but it was the ruling class. So we did learn some Amharic and learned it fairly well. But by the time we got to Ethiopia as English teachers, I don't think our language improved a lot more after that because we felt our obligation was to use English with our students and we were with our students, not only throughout the class day, but just about every evening we would have students over just out of curiosity. They wanted to see who we were. See our kerosene generated refrigerator. Learn about America and see if maybe we would take them with us when we went home."

It was mostly just a lot of class time learning about Ethiopia and how to work there and how to be teachers, frankly, because I think most of us were simply college graduates. So we did do some, uh, we monitored some classes in Los Angeles and did a lot of practice teaching. We had teachers trying to teach us how to do that.

        "utterance": "They gave us shots before we left UCLA. One of them is gamma globulin, which makes it virtually impossible to sit on a plane to fly from California to St. Louis and Kansas City. And before we left, one of the major concerns I think a lot of trainees had was the term selected out. There are several people who were selected out, one of whom was a man named Conrad Hirsch, who was probably one of the brightest and most creative of the volunteers. I don't know firsthand why he was selected out, but there were three, two or three reasons given in rumors around the campus. One was that he went to Reed College, which was quite liberal. Another was that he had a beard and none of the rest of us did in those days. I later did.\n\nAnd the third was that he had actually lived with a woman he was not married to. So my understanding was that he was selected out because somebody decided he wasn't going to be a desirable volunteer. When we finally got to Ethiopia, it was several days later, Conrad was already there and he became one of the best volunteers. I don't know how he got back into the Peace Corps, but it worked. When we left UCLA and flew to St. Louis and Kansas City to say goodbye to our families, we sold my car, which was a car that I'd inherited from my family, a little Ford Falcon. And we used the money while we were in New York to go to Boston to the Parker House, to spend the night and have Parker House rolls before we went to Ethiopia."

It was very cold and wet, and she was in bed with this sort of military dark green brown blanket over her. And she had a brown bottle that she was holding in her hand. It was a bottle of niche gas, not niche gas. It was a bottle of water. And we took the photograph on a camera that I had received from my father and we didn't develop it. I think we sent the film back home to be developed. And my mother, when she developed the film, was a little curious about that photograph of Courtney in bed with a brown bottle. And I had to explain to her in a letter that that was just bubbly water.\n\nI don't remember much more. I think we spent probably a couple of days on the Haile Selassie I University campus getting some orientation and learning where we were going to be spending the rest of our two years there. We did. And every volunteer was a guest at the home of an Ethiopian. Courtney and I went to dinner at the home of Tomyskin Gobena, who was some middle level official in the Highway Department of the government of Ethiopia. And that's when we first ate native food and realized not only how hot the wat could be, the sauce that you use to dip your injera in. But also tella is a barley beer that traditionally is served in a large glass with a lot of barley seeds floating on top.\n\nAnd I couldn't figure out where there was supposed to swallow the barley seeds or kind of strain them through my teeth as I drank this sort of bitter, dark brown homemade beer. They also served something called tej, which is a fermented honey, which is a little too sweet for me. But it was a very impressive dinner, and it really showed us how we were in a totally different country. Very gracious hosts. I think only to Tomyskin spoke English. I think he had children, but I don't remember whether they were speaking English or not. It was kind of an awkward dinner. It was our first exposure to a home in Ethiopia. But we learned a lot."

When we arrived in Dire Dawa, we met Fuller Torrey, the doctor for the region. He and his wife and children were living there, and we were in the company of probably five or six other volunteers from our training program. Checked into a little hotel.

In order to get there from Addis, although we went to Dire Dawa to take a Land Rover to Asebe Teferi, generally what you'd do is you get on the train and ride about seven hours to a little desert town called Mieso, which is about halfway to Dire Dawa. And you get off the train in Mieso and you wait for a bus, a little, you know, a 20-seater bus that has a lot of loud music. And that bus will drive you up into the mountains to up to Asebe Teferi. And that's about maybe 45 minutes or an hour ride."

And that's one of the more exciting experiences of life in Ethiopia. There were three classes of train and we took the third class car and I generally ended up tucked under a bench along with some trussed chickens. People sitting above us on the benches were Ethiopian women taking their chickens to market. And when I wanted a little fresh air, I would go to the end of the car. And I don't recall that there were doors on these cars. You just kind of grab on to a railing before you would step off the train. But this train is going quite fast through the dark and the desert, and you could just hang on to that bar and sit on that lower step and just feel the cold desert air running by and in the darkness see little lights off in the distance."

No. [name in Amharic] And it was a school for probably kindergarten through eighth grade, and we were to be the four teachers that would augment the current Ethiopian staff so they could start a ninth and then a 10th grade in the school.\n\nAnd I think that most of these students had very good support from their parents because they wanted us to. They wanted these children to learn and stay in their own town instead of having to, uh. Many of these students came from little villages all around and even down near Mieso in the desert. So they were able to come to this school rather than go way down to the larger, much larger town of Dire Dawa at a school where many of them would get into trouble. So because we were able to offer additional grades in the school, which after we left became a twelve grade school. We got a lot of support from the parents about making sure the children were there and very committed to their studies. And most of those kids were very good students and tried very hard."

And I think this is one of the reasons they had put in this brand-new crushed rock road and built this town of Asebe Teferi. So when we got there, as I say, I think it was probably about a 10 or 15 year old town. The school was only those first eight grades and it was a new school, the only. There was one other school in the town, but that was a religious school where very little children were learning to memorize the Koran. And in Ge'ez, an ancient language of Ethiopia, which is sort of related to Amharic."

Asmaram was a brilliant anthropologist who had done a, written a book that I thought was titled The Gurage. And so the place where we ended up for two years of our lives was in the center of what we thought was the Gurage people. Most of our students were Amharas, the sons and daughters of Ethiopians who had settled in Asebe Teferi, either as the children of government officials or traders, merchants, and in some cases, military and large landowners.\n\nBut the native population of that area was what we now identify as Oromo, and the Oromo are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia. They predominate in the south where Asebe Teferi is, and they have been. The conflict between the Oromo and the Amhara has been the genesis of a lot of the unrest and, fortunately for recent events, possibly a way forward for a very multi-ethnic country to develop. But the Oromo at that time were very misunderstood, even apparently by the anthropologist who had written this book about what he called the Gurage. Gurage, it turned out, is a pejorative for farmers in that region, and they were not Gurage, they were Oromo. So that was one of the lessons that we didn't actually learn for a long time during our two years.\n\nMost of our relationships with the students, most of whom are Amharas and Christians, members of their families raised in the Coptic Church. There were a few who were Muslim. One of them, Mahadi Hamid, turns out much later in my life I learned was an Oromo. But I just knew that there were a few Muslims in the town. Some of the merchants who chewed chaat and sat in the little alcove in their shops, selling fabrics and dry goods. But most of the people in the town, I believe, were Amhara and therefore a Coptic Christian. And the homes we visited as the students would take us home to meet their parents and have a dinner were, I believe, Amharas."

We were not very far from the Ogaden desert, which has been a point of conflict between Somalia and Ethiopia for many, many years. Some of the students in our school were Somali, and two of them lived with us. Mohamed Taher and Mohamed Haji. There was a teacher in our town, Otto Tahir, who for whatever reason, I don't know, refused to speak to Courtney or I, or to either Elaine or Pat to any great extent. And he was, I believe, an English teacher.\n\nBut one time he went missing and he was brought back many weeks later. And the principal of the school, Otto Nagatu, announced one morning that he wanted all his teachers in the school to lead their students down to the market. Because Otto Tahir had been arrested and had been charged I believe with treason, and that we were to lead the students down there and create a, surround this area where we would then watch and did watch the military whip 21 times Otto Tahir on the ground in the center of the market. It turns out, at least according to other teachers, Otto Tahir had been in a bar one evening and it said something negative about the emperor and he was arrested.\n\nHe was in the bar and he was complaining because he and other teachers had not received their salaries for some time. And so this ended up to be his punishment. And I don't know whatever happened to Otto Tahir, but he never came back to teach in the school again. It was one of the shocks we had about corporal punishment that occurs in the country and the ethnic divisions, certainly between ethnic Somalis who are citizens of Ethiopia, such as our own two students, and as well as later the Oromo. So it was one of the. One of the awakenings we had to what was a very, very stressed culture in Ethiopia in addition to being a very poor economy."

And as the four of us were preparing our classes every morning, we'd get together with our work and I would crank out the copies so that they could distribute to the students questions or examinations or lesson plans. But we had no original texts. There was a library in the school. It was locked. And also Nagatu eventually would allow, allowed us to go in and organize the Dewey Decimal System and open the library for the use of the students. And that was mostly the work of Eileen and Pat and Courtney.\n\nBut we did find in that closed library a copy of a social studies book published in the United States, probably in the 1940s. And one of the things I recall from the book was a photograph of an Afrikaans holding a stick or a rod of some kind in a field as a South African was working in the field. I don't know what kind of crop it was, but the caption underneath the photograph addressed the South African as a coolie. And we generally decided that we would not expose the students to this anything in this book. So I quickly sent a letter to Parker Lad, who was one of the people who I'd interviewed with in New York. I think he'd worked for Scott Foresman, I'm not sure, but he sent us some brand-new copies, at least for teachers, reference of some social studies books that were more current and a lot more appropriate.\n\nAnd Courtney and I were looking through our letters recently and realized how much we depended on our families for other books and Cub Scout uniforms, Boy Scout uniforms, and more books for the library and more books for us. Mostly to be able to get good information to use for teaching math, social studies, geography, and English."

But Mahdi was one of the brighter students, spoke English very well, turned out to be Oromo, but I really hadn't quite figured that out. But he was definitely a little different than the Amhara students. And he had mentioned that he has a brother that worked at the U.N. for the Ethiopian Embassy, and I don't remember much about that. But I would have characterized him at the time as being very, very proud and very confident of his own interpretation of the information he had received over his life.\n\nAnd at one point we had a disagreement about something, and for some reason he and I agreed that we would just not speak to each other for a long period of time. And before we left, Courtney and I left Ethiopia, he gave us a handmade out of plywood guitar that he had made, which was incredible and we were very touched. I didn't, we didn't have any contact with Mahdi after that until about ten, eight or nine years ago when as a supervisor of broadcasting for Voice of America, I was supervising Amharas and Tigrays and Oromo, who were broadcasting to Ethiopia for Voice of America in a department called the Horn of Africa. And one afternoon we realized we had some reporting that a group of American students from a program in California had been traveling this summer in Ethiopia, and in fact, not far from where we had lived.\n\nBut they were in a very politically and militarily sensitive area near the Ogaden. And for some reason, the local police and military arrested all of the students and took them to Addis Ababa and deported them. There was a gentleman, an Ethiopian, who was their guide. He was a U.S. resident who had taken these students over for this California program. And we were concerned about reporting about the deportations until this Ethiopian was able to get out of the country safely. When he did, I received a phone number for him. He was living in Atlanta. He was a high school teacher and I called him and I introduced myself and he said, Mr. Arnold! And that's me.\n\nAnd I was shocked to find out this was Mahdi Hamid, who now is Hamid Muudee and is the author of a two volume English to Oromo dictionary, which he has inscribed to me and sent to me with photographs of his family. And I haven't, I have yet to meet him. I still hope that we can. But it was incredible to, after decades of not seeing Mahdi and knowing that we'd had this difference of opinion at one point in my short teaching career, that we would meet again on the phone. And it was a wonderful sort of aural reunion, I will treasure it and I hope that we get to meet again."

But while I was there, I did run into, uh, I didn't run into. I actually had an appointment to meet with Mingesha Woltom McHale, who was another one of our young students. Mingesha was one of the most earnest and dedicated students that we knew. Very, very young.\n\nAll these boys, the younger boys, were barefoot and wore torn shorts and torn shirts. They were all from very poor families and Mingesha was one that was almost every afternoon at our house and just so curious about who we were and how much he could learn. He may not have been the absolute most, the brightest student in the class, but he was the most dedicated to learning. And he did become quite a good friend of ours over the years, although he never came to the United States and died several years ago."

        "utterance": "The one, the interesting thing about being a teacher. I don't think I was an excellent teacher. I had limited experience before I got there and it was totally within the context of the Ethiopian education system that I think all of us learned how to be teachers. It's difficult to say how much we had an impact on any individual. It's certainly true, and I think most Peace Corps volunteers say that we're never very sure how much we contributed to the country or to the community we served in. But we know how much of a difference it made in our own lives. There is one person among this all the students that I recall in that school that was probably the most successful in her later life.\n\nHer name is Debrework Zewdie and Debrework was in my English class and it was eighth grade. All the girls sat in the front row, and they were all very, very quiet, very shy, and did very good work. And Debrework was one of these students sitting in the front row. And she did excellent work, not always, but she was a very sincere student. I didn't see her after she left for many, many years. But when I was returning from Ethiopia maybe 10 years ago and arrived at Dulles International Airport, Courtney was waiting for me and standing next to her was an Ethiopian gentleman. And we soon discovered that he, his wife, had grown up in Asebe Teferi. And just after that, this Ethiopian woman came up behind me. She was on the same flight that I was. And we discovered that it was Debrework Zewdie.\n\nAnd I won't take a lot of time to read this, but I just googled her name. She is a an immunologist, former director of the World Bank Global AIDS program, and deputy executive director and chief operating officer of the Global Fund. So I'm very impressed that I had this, at least for one year, this little girl in my class. But what is more interesting than that is that when we met at the airport and I explained who I was, she didn't remember me. So that makes me continue to be very modest about my achievements as a teacher."

Because we were inexperienced teachers and had, at least in the beginning, very few resources to prepare for classes, we spent just about every weekday evening sitting at a little table in our house with a Chinese macho. It's called the Aeroplane, A-E-R-O-P-L-A-N-E, was the brand of the kerosene lantern from China that had a very large hood over it. And we would sit on either side of the table from this macho lantern that gave us our light and do our lesson plans and just do all of the work that a teacher is supposed to be doing at night. Friday nights, we would often go to a bar called the Rocket Bar, and this would all at that time be spelled in the particular alphabet of the Amharic language.\n\nAnd incidentally, when I went back many years later. After the one particular government, the Derg, was replaced and there was more of an effort by the new government to create ethnic diversity within the country, the Oromo region, which we lived in, decided to adopt the Roman alphabet. And so when I went back to visit the Rocket Bar with Mingesha, I could spell it because it was all in English."

The one thing that had changed was that they had adopted a new tree that people there called the Truman tree, which is a smaller, less magnificent tree, but apparently has something to do with reducing the population of flies."

She had many, many younger sisters and often some of those younger sisters would come with her to watch and gape at us or help her with some of her work. But Ammina and Mohammed Tahir, one of the two Mohammeds who lived in the house, had a room at the back of our house, struck up a very strong friendship. Later after we left and he graduated from high school, they married and Mohammad Tahir worked for, I believe it was Save the Children in probably Dire Dawa and further into the Ogaden for many years. And we have kept in touch with he and his children occasionally as Mohammed and Ammina grew older."

We were eager to come home, but Peace Corps was looking for experienced volunteers to serve in Micronesia. And we considered it but decided it was really time to go home. So when we left, we did the obligatory travel through Europe and go to Istanbul, Beirut, Athens, Munich. Buy a Volkswagen in Munich, have it shipped home. Then go to France and England and then go to New York and wait for the car to arrive."

        "utterance": "We probably had four or five weeks traveling in Europe and then waited for two weeks in New York City at the Diplomat Hotel, which was favored by, I think, a lot of people from the Caribbean. It was very inexpensive. And when we finally. That also gave me an opportunity to look for a job. I had imagined at the time I was a teacher in Ethiopia, writing curriculum or textbooks of the very much what I had learned about teaching and about social studies while I was a teacher in Ethiopia. But when we got home, I decided I really needed to get a real job. And the probably the most appropriate thing was to look in a trade magazine for journalists and found a job in Sandusky, Ohio, as a reporter.\n\nSo when we left New York City in our brand-new little VW Bug, green with a sunroof and a luggage rack, we ended up in Sandusky. I interviewed and got the job. Courtney got a job teaching in Norwalk, Ohio, which is in fact where we ended up living, not far from Sandusky. And that's where I became the Huron County bureau chief for the Sandusky Register. Did that for two years. Went to the University of Missouri to graduate school and finished a master's degree in journalism. And then took, there are three jobs since then working for newspapers. And ended up freelancing magazine writing for a while.\n\nThe journalism was intended to be an introduction to writing books, writing novels, because I had so much enjoyed so many good writers that I had studied in college. But it ended up being a very permanent job, journalism did. Freelance magazine writing in Eugene, Oregon, for a considerable amount of time. What that ended up being, because I met you and Beryl Brinkman and several others who were returned Peace Corps volunteers living in Eugene, became my introduction to the National Peace Corps Association and to in a sense, embrace strong commitment to international issues. We had several major events that we hosted in Eugene, one of which was the national conference for the National Peace Corps Association.\n\nAnd through my friendship with you, I learned about the Fulbright program and received a Fulbright to study in Pakistan teaching journalism at the Quaid-i-Azam University in Lahore, the second oldest city in the world. It was quite an exciting experience that I directly attribute to not only my friendship with you, but just, we were Peace Corps volunteers. And we were always interested in other countries and issues that reflected on those countries. The Fulbright in Pakistan was quickly terminated due to the first Gulf War. We ended up in Kenya for the balance of two years."

Leakey, and meeting a lot of very interesting journalists and scholars and scientists at the national museums. From there, we, and Courtney was teaching at the International School of Kenya during that two-year period in Nairobi when we, I had not only the Fulbright, but a Ford Foundation grant to help with that work. But when we realized it was really time again to come back to the United States, I heard from Beryl that Chic Dambach, then the president of the National Peace Corps Association, which was then called the National Council of Returned Peace Corps Volunteers, was looking for an editor of a four year old magazine they had called WorldView, and I ended up editing WorldView for the NPCA for about 15 years.\n\nDuring that time on an AID contract, I went back to Ethiopia to do some consulting and journalism, as I mentioned earlier. And after about 15 years at the NPCA, I took a job with the federal government at Voice of America, and that's when I became the supervisor of Eritrea and Tigray, Amhara, and Oromo speakers broadcasting to Ethiopia and supervising them. I got to go back to Ethiopia two or three times. And to argue with government officials who had a very different view of free press than we do in the United States. And after eight years at VOA, I retired from the government and am now on contract editing WorldView magazine again for the NPCA. So I think that all of that is certainly directly attributable to our Peace Corps experience in Ethiopia."

        "utterance": "We have two children, Chapin and Tim. Tim would have been older now had it not been for the fact that as Peace Corps volunteers the federal government frowned upon your having children while you were in service. So Courtney and I were introduced to the concept of the birth control pill. When we returned to the United States, we had, uh, Tim was born in Norwalk, Ohio. He now lives in Silver Spring, Maryland, as a husband and father of two children, one of whom is now a sophomore at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. The other is a senior in high school. Our daughter Chapin was born a year later. She now lives in Fairfax, Virginia, with her husband, Ray, and their two children. And we see them not often enough because they're all very busy families.\n\nBut neither Tim or Chapin chose to become Peace Corps volunteers. And we know that many of our friends and colleagues from Peace Corps do have children who had that same experience. I think our children, because we raised them in Eugene, Oregon, it was a very counterculture community and they had their own little experience with learning cultures. And probably had a little too much of our history of the Peace Corps to really want to follow in our footsteps. They had other things they wanted to do. Chapin became a very accomplished ballerina in high school. And Tim, Tim's drumming was exceptional, and his ambition to be a rock drummer sort of transcended any other obligations he had to life for several years.\n\nIt was fascinating to watch both of our children develop skills that were very much appropriate to the community they lived in. Tim, in fact, moved on to Seattle and became very well-known with a couple of good bands that toured the country. They were on major record labels. And he is now working for a web design company that serves nonprofits like Planned Parenthood. Our daughter Chapin works for a direct mail company in Washington, and they're both very successful without Peace Corps experience."

        "utterance": "Well, my father was an engineer. He passed away when I was very young, but I felt like I wanted to be an engineer. He was a practical engineer. He had his own company.\\n\\n So when I went off to college, I focused on being a practical engineer and particularly in materials metallurgy, which is part of his expertise. I discovered that I’d probably be fifty years old by the time I was an expert in that area, so I slowly became, if you want, more interested in science, more theoretical things.\\n\\n I had very little money. I was interested in pursuing graduate work. I also had a girlfriend. I was going to get married. So I was looking for a position for a couple of years to make some money and then go back to graduate school. I had used some NACA [National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics] reports in my work in undergraduate school, and I was very impressed with those reports. They were sort of in between the journal articles and textbooks, and they were very complete. Of course, Sputnik had come along and space activity was starting, but I was so focused on my studies, I really wasn’t aware of the broader world at the time, you might say. I was interested in doing research and gaining an understanding of things.\\n\\n When I interviewed NASA, I looked at it as the NACA. Like I said, I was interested in doing research, so I asked if that’s what I’d be doing and was told yes. So I accepted a job offer with them. It was not the most lucrative, but it seemed to be the best foundation for what I thought I wanted to do.\\n\\n Came to work at the Space Task Group at Langley [Research Center, Hampton, Virginia] and at the time I didn’t realize the difference between the Space Task Group and the Langley Research Center. I was interested in doing research. So after a few months when I figured all this out, I was trying to transfer to the Langley Research Center and had a very interesting opportunity there.\\n\\n But Bob [Robert E.] Vale, Aleck [C.] Bond, called me in and said, “You don’t want to do that. We’ve got some real challenges here in space flight.” They interested me in a particular challenge on the Apollo. By the way, my very first job when I went to work was working on the Apollo. That was in 1961. It was sort of, well, looking at the configuration and the aerodynamics, but I had no view as to what Apollo was to become at the time.\\n\\n In any event, there had been some newspaper publications that one could not bring men back from the Moon because of the thermal radiation from the gas cap. It was a nonequilibrium phenomenon, which I had done a little work in nonequilibrium when I was an undergraduate, and it was a real challenge. They said, “Your job would be to take two years and understand this phenomenon and let us know, indeed can we come back from the Moon or will it burn up the capsule or whatever. We don’t really understand what this is.” That was exciting, and also the time frame was right, because I wanted to go back to graduate school.\\n\\n So I started to pursue that. There was a contract that had already been under way to AVCO [Corporation] Everett [Massachusetts Division] research organization, which was an outstanding small elite research organization. They had shock tubes that were far in excess of anything that NASA had at the time and were most appropriate for understanding or doing diagnostics on very strong shock waves.\\n\\n Briefly, at equilibrium for Apollo entry, the gas cap at equilibrium is about 10,000 degrees Rankin or 6,000 Kelvin. That’s equivalent to what the apparent temperature of the sun is; that is, the sun’s radiation is like black body radiation from about 10,000 Rankin. So the equilibrium temperature of the gas in front of the capsule coming back from the Moon was basically the same as that. But the nonequilibrium temperature right behind the shock, if one does a quick calculation, is like a hundred thousand degrees. That is what gave rise to the predictions that the radiation from that high temperature would burn the capsule up.\\n\\n Well, it turned out to be very interesting phenomena. There were diagnostics made at AVCO and other places, but primarily at AVCO that could get the higher shock speeds, characterizing the radiation behind the shock. What happened was the temperature indeed went to very high value, but all the energy was in translational form, not in the excited states that are needed to radiate. So the radiation, indeed, would shoot up and exceed by two orders of magnitude the radiation from the equilibrium gas, but it happened very quickly, and so the total integrated radiation coming to the capsule was limited. It turned out actually that the equilibrium radiation was more important to the heating to the capsule, comparable to the convective heating, which was all new at these high velocities, if you want.\\n\\n So my first real challenge was to understand that. AVCO did all the real work. They took the data, did the basic analysis, but the idea was for me to take that basic information and apply it to the entry of Apollo and understand what the heat transfer would be so that we’d understand better what the thermal protection or the ablator characteristics had to be. So that was my first job, and it was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it. I felt like indeed I was contributing, although once we understood it, there was no doubt that we could bring people back from the Moon, but initially there was a question, like lots of other questions.\\n\\n It was also the first time I ran into the bureaucracy, if you want. This contract had been in place prior to my joining that particular group, and it ran for two years to get adequate data to understand that, which was my time constant for understanding it. As I mentioned before, we then understood that the equilibrium radiation was more important to the heat transfer and we needed an accurate assessment of that radiation for the heat transfer to the capsule. So I’d asked for an extension of the contract to AVCO to get some additional spectroscopic data and characterize the equilibrium radiation.\\n\\n Well, I don’t remember the details, but it turned out that someone in Washington had decided—and at this point we had moved to Houston, it was the Manned Spacecraft Center—that we don’t need some young kid at MSC monitoring a contract with these great people at AVCO. This is more for our senior scientists at the research centers, and so they, which completely oblivious to me, had pulled a maneuver where they had a contract with AVCO and when I tried to renew the contract to get the information that we needed for the heat transfer to the Apollo, I got a telephone call and said, “You can’t do that. We already have a contract with them.”\\n\\n So I had to explain to the people in Washington the need for this information for Apollo, and they modified their contract a little bit so we eventually got it, but there was a year delay, unfortunately, so that hurt the design a little bit. But their intentions were honorable. MSC was new, it was a project center, they don’t do research, so they don’t need this basic information. But as a matter of fact, we needed that very basic information because it was far beyond our experience in terms of thermal radiation from high temperature gasses. We needed accurate numbers, and it was way outside the experience base. We eventually got it.\\n\\n The Langley Research Center did a project, staying with this radiation heating, where they had a small replica of the Apollo, and they fired it into the atmosphere. Its whole purpose was to make measurements of the radiative and convective heating. It was a Fire One, Fire Two project. It was a Fire Project. They had essentially a radiometer at the center, a little window, with a calorimeter behind. I think that might have been what we put on Apollo, but in any event, they had an instrument on Fire to measure radiation at flight conditions comparable to the Apollo. They did that.\\n\\n Unfortunately, the practical things always get to you. The first flight, the data was extremely strange, it varied up and down, up and down, and the magnitude was not at all what we were expecting. It turned out in order to get to the lunar return conditions, they went up essentially to orbital conditions and then had a stage that fired the capsule down into the atmosphere, and they had a spring system that separated the two. All of the calculations showed that it would clear nicely.\\n\\n But what wasn’t anticipated evidently, as I understand it, was the wake from the capsule gave less resistance to the kick stage, and so it basically rode the wake up and clobbered the capsule. So when the capsule was coming in, it was doing this, and as a result, the center of the capsule, which was to be at stagnation point, was off center all the time and nutated around. Because of the oscillations, the characteristics of the gas that it was looking at were changing all the time, so the radiation, which is very sensitive to that, was going up and down.\\n\\n The second flight, however, was very good. They had a better separation mechanism when they understood what had happened to the first one, and we had some beautiful data. That actually formed the best basis for the correlation of the nonequilibrium radiation. It was pretty much what we were expecting, except it, as I mentioned, simulated as best they could the entry of the Apollo capsule, and what could not be done in the shock tube on the ground facility was to get to the very low densities at high attitudes. What we discovered with Fire was that there was a phenomenon what we termed collision limiting. There were not enough collisions to excite the energetic states of the nitrogen and oxygen atoms or molecules so that the radiation never actually occurred at the very high altitudes. As we came down in peak heating, we did get the radiation.\\n\\n So I correlated that, and later on on the test flights of Apollo, 501, 502, that came in simulating the lunar return entry, the correlation was quite good. In fact, Chul Park, a fellow from Ames Research Center [Mountain View, California], I’m bouncing way ahead here, we had different views as to what the nonequilibrium radiation phenomena were. In fact, we had planned to have an aeroassist flight experiment here fairly recently before I retired to look at the radiation at higher velocities and higher attitudes. We were interested in designing, just like we have a shuttle to go from the Earth to lower earth orbit, we had designed, had a concept for a vehicle that would run from lower earth orbit up to geosynchronous orbit, where most of our assets in space are, to provide service and repair and so forth, and then just come back to lower earth orbit, never come to the ground.\\n\\n Now, that was a challenge to get to a reusable system because of the heat shield. It was a challenge to develop a reusable heat shield for the Shuttle. We did master that, but we’re really pushing the limits of materials, material temperatures. So now to come back from geosynchronous, which is like coming back from the Moon, it’s far more severe than Earth entry, we really had to understand that environment quite precisely to design a vehicle to do that.\\n\\n In any event, we had planned an aeroassist flight experiment which was a small capsule, kind of like the Fire was to Apollo, okay, to verify our understanding of the entry environment and the thermal protection performance. Chul and I had quite a disagreement about what was going on. I just recently received a paper from Chul, and he has concluded that the difficulty in terms of our dispute—he’s very much a theoretician, does outstanding work, but his results and my results were always quite different. I had basically a more empirical approach, if you want, basic phenomenon, but empirical approach, and the correlation between the Fire and the Apollo results, I had a lot of confidence in that. But his theoretical calculations were significantly higher. Well, I just, as I said, received a paper just recently from him where he has now sorted out that the problem was actually in the National Bureau of Standards f numbers. This is a characteristic associated with the probability of a radiating states for atoms and molecules. With some new computations, they have upgraded those, and so now we’re very much in agreement. [Laughter] That’s just sort of, if you want, my specialty in radiation."

        "utterance": "No. No. We’re now in complete agreement. Well, he does things that I could not do. He’s quite a brilliant theoretician and with the computational power that exists today—we were working on vacuum tubes in Apollo days. Nowadays, in fact, when we get into the Shuttle, we’ll talk about some computational fluid dynamics [CFD] there.\\n\\n But in any event, the radiation was a real challenge. When I completed it, I was ready to go back to graduate school, and NASA basically said, “Well, you can go part-time here at Rice [University] or U of H [University of Houston] and continue working. We’ll give you a little time off.” Well, by this time I was married, I had at least one child, and I still didn’t have very much money, so that was a great deal, and I really enjoyed the work with NASA.\\n\\n On the Apollo, I was focused pretty much on the thermal radiation. When the Shuttle came along, I had broader responsibilities, and there the challenge was to develop a reusable thermal protection system [TPS]. On Mercury and Apollo, we had a very thick ablator, and it basically is a material that’s consumed, if you want, as you come in. For the manned vehicles, we come in at high altitudes, relatively low dynamic pressure, so that astronauts do not experience too high a deceleration as opposed to, for example, in a missile that bore right in at very high pressures. So even though it’s all entry heating and thermal production, the two areas are actually quite separate. The thermal protection on the manned vehicles, most of that energy that is received as heat transfer is reradiated, as opposed to at the high pressures the penetrating entries, it’s more ablated, if you want. The material is consumed.\\n\\n So that led us to with the Shuttle challenge, the big challenges on the Shuttle were the avionics, the reusable engines, and the thermal protection system. I never had responsibility for the thermal protection system, but I did have responsibility for the environment, the heat transfer convective and not much radiative for Shuttle.\\n\\n So on the Shuttle, which was a big engineering challenge in many respects, to build a reusable vehicle, on the thermal protection system, we were really pushing the edges of materials. The candidate materials when we started really would not do the job. The ceramics that were later developed in concert with the Shuttle just barely made it. We got a lot of bad press about these fragile tiles, but the problem was the high temperatures that we experience. The first requirement was to make the vehicle very large, which reduces the temperature. The heat transfer is inversely proportional to characteristic dimension. So for a large-scale system, you have a better chance, if you want.\\n\\n But what I learned from Apollo, even though I was responsible just for the radiative heating, we came back and about half of the ablator was charred on the Apollo, order of half, except for one region near the front where there was a pressure gradient and you actually had flow through the ablator, and that we had just about the right amount of ablator in that region.\\n\\n But anyway, for the Shuttle, we couldn’t afford two thicknesses of thermal protection system. It had to be reusable. Looking at Apollo, I remember the meeting with Joe [Joseph F.] Shea and Dale [D.] Myers. Dale was at Rockwell [International, Corp.]. Joe Shea was the program manager at Apollo. A presentation was give and by [R.] Bryan Erb, and it was entitled “To Shea (Touché) and Myers.” [Laughter]\\n\\n But in any event, the conditions for the design of the Apollo ablator, there was just a little bit of conservatism in each area, that is, the heating environment, the material properties, the temperature limits from the material standpoint, the structural temperature limits, the trajectories, in terms of where we might fly. On Apollo, that was a crash program, and we didn’t have computers to do all sorts of Monte Carlo simulations. They were just starting that type of capability. So the environment was established for the design of the thermal protection system, which was obviously what I’m discussing, was established on a basis of what are the limiting trajectories. The one limit was to penetrate in at the limit of the deceleration that an astronaut could stand. Obviously if you went any deeper than that, the design didn’t matter.\\n\\n The other limit was if you stayed in the atmosphere for a long time such that if you were just a little bit higher you’d skip out and be gone for another two weeks, if you want, which we also could not tolerate, it was a narrow window. But the environmental limits in terms of the heating to the vehicle between those two were quite significantly different. In fact, the [AS-]501 simulated fairly closely the one, the severe environment, and the 502 simulated the other, which was to fly along as long as you can. That’s lower heating, but a much higher heat load. Those were the two conditions for the design of the thermal protection system. Very conservative.\\n\\n But the real conservatism in the design that led to twice as much ablator as we needed was not in any one area, but rather each area had put in their 10 percent, and when you take all the different areas and multiply it all out, that’s a factor of two. So having learned that, what we did on the Shuttle was we tried to avoid what I called a compound conservatism. In other words, the system design involved a statistical consideration of all uncertainties in the input. Then, if you want, the program manager could design whether he wanted a one sigma or two sigma or three sigma heat shield.\\n\\n That was kind of a novel concept in spacecraft design and so forth. We never really got a hundred percent approval because it was a little different from designing airplanes and spacecraft, but that’s effectively what we did. As a result, we ended up with a thermal protection system which was just right, in many respects. Nothing’s perfect, but we certainly didn’t have twice the thermal protection system that we needed on the Shuttle, as we did with the Apollo. So that also was a big challenge.\\n\\n My area of responsibility, again, was the environment. There’s no significant thermal radiation, but we had to understand the gas, the gas flow around the vehicle. It was very three-dimensional, far beyond the ability of wind tunnels to simulate on the ground, and so we had to do some significant analysis and get to a good understanding. Now, that type of challenge, if you want, has been with us all the way through the space program. In the early days of Mercury, which I didn’t work on, that was an all new environment. I mean, we had zero experience in terms of what the environment was and what was needed for thermal protection.\\n\\n Then we went to Apollo and essentially twice the energy, more than twice the heat transfer and heat flux. With the Shuttle now, trying to develop a reusable system, again, it wasn’t a simple capsule. It was a very three-dimensional flow. Apollo was also three-dimensional, but it wasn’t nearly as significant as it was with the Shuttle. During Apollo, we had done some very rudimentary computational fluid mechanics, which is the current buzz word, if you want, just for the radiation, because the radiation is a very strong function of the temperature. As you get flow around the vehicle, the temperature is highest in the stagnation region, characteristically, and then falls off slightly as you go around the vehicle, but that slight fall-off was a tremendous fall-off in the radiation heating.\\n\\n So we had to model the gas flow around the Apollo vehicle. Now, for the convective heating what one needed it was the surface conditions, and we had a lot of insight from the wind tunnel as to what that was. For the flow around the vehicle, we were not close to that condition in the wind tunnel and so we had to do a lot of jerry-rigging and engineering, if you want. I mean, it’s based on a fundamental understanding of what’s going on, but the ability to compute all that didn’t exist.\\n\\n So, for example, the shape of the shock around a vehicle, we would take a schlieren in the wind tunnel, which is characteristically like a Mach 8 condition. We had to go to Mach 33. This meant that the density relative to the free stream in front of capsule increased by a factor of three at least so that the shock approached the body. In the limit, if you go to infinite Mach number, the shock basically conforms to the body. So we approximated that and then made calculations of the temperature around, so very rudimentary flow field calculations in order to compute the radiative heating.\\n\\n So I was a little aware of the importance of understanding the entire flow for radiation for Apollo. When we got to the Shuttle, the complex geometry that we had, we had to understand the flow in order to provide the convective heating at the surface. So we, along with many others around the country, were pursuing computational fluid dynamics and basically pushing the computers to do what we needed to do. Now, by the time we actually flew the Shuttle, we were able to compute heat transfer along the surface, not over the entire vehicle, but over the hottest regions, if you want, about as accurately as you could measure it in the wind tunnel. Today I think we could do even better on regions of the vehicle where we have difficulty measuring in the wind tunnel because of not as severe environment, but an important environment.\\n\\n So there’s been quite a revolution from vacuum tube computers, if you want, to computational fluid dynamics, which can, if it’s done correctly, give you even better information than the wind tunnel. Now, a lot of people say, “Well, we don’t need the wind tunnels anymore,” and we don’t probably need as many. But when you get an answer out of a computer and you get information out of a computer, how do you know that it’s correct? How do you know there’s not a bug in the system and you’re computing something that looks pretty but has nothing to do with reality?\\n\\n So what we did with the Shuttle was we used the computation of fluid dynamics to compute what’s going on in the wind tunnel, and we measured in the wind tunnel, and when they didn’t jibe, either we weren’t measuring properly or we weren’t computing properly, and that was a fun challenge to the Shuttle."

The equations are valid, the computer is valid, it just does what you tell it to do. But marrying the two together to get legitimate description of physically what’s going on is a challenge and is still a challenge. That area is advancing rapidly, not just in computational fluid dynamics but the principles are being used in many, many different areas now.\\n\\n So the reason for all that discussion is I started this saying I was interested in research and understanding and pursuing challenges in that area, and, boy, we really had them in the space program. I enjoyed them more being close to the application than I think I would have if I had been in a research center where 100 percent of my time was focused on the basic work. The marriage, if you want, the need for the research really makes it a challenge. It makes it a lot of fun.\\n\\n A lot of research is done just because an individual is interested in understanding, and that’s great. But when not only an individual is interested but there’s a need for it, you need it to bring a man back from the Moon or you need it to get a reusable vehicle, that really makes it a challenge and exciting, a lot of fun.\\n\\n We learned from each step, if you want, from the various projects that we’ve had. I’m reminded, Dotty [Dorothy B.] Lee used to tell me about Bob [Robert R.] Gilruth and PARD, the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division, and the fun they had, but that experience, in my opinion, was crucial for the ultimate success of our space program because we had people who had small projects, had responsibility, and as Guy [Joseph G.] Thibodaux says, got to make mistakes and learn from mistakes. These little projects of launching an experimental vehicle on a rocket to make some measurements of heat transfer and aerodynamics taught a lot of people lessons about how things actually get done, and that experience basically just blossomed into experience with Mercury and then with Apollo and then with Shuttle.\\n\\n That element, I think, was necessary for a successful space program, particularly on our side, that is, the manned vehicle part of it. I very much support the concept of small projects for people to develop with so that we can then do big projects, because if you don’t have people with experience sort of all the way across the board, it’s much easier to make big mistakes instead of little mistakes.\\n\\n When I was growing up, when we had “a” telephone company, the reputation of the telephone company was that when you went to work for them, you started by climbing the poles. In other words, you started from the ground and you worked your way up so that someone who became a big manager in a telephone company at least had experienced all levels of activities. I think that was a very good approach, and to a certain extent, we kind of fell into it, but that’s sort of what we did with NASA. I think it’s a very important aspect that many times is overlooked. We go off and study things in school, but that’s not like actually having done it, if you want. You need people who have done it at all levels in order to make decisions relative to what should be done.\\n\\n I’m a little concerned right now about NASA from the standpoint of we have grown from small projects, based on NACA [National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics] and other organizations, into these large ones, and through that development phase, we had people who had experienced various levels. Well, now we seem to have all these big projects, and the people coming in don’t have the experience base of the small projects and what’s involved in having a broader picture of the projects. So people come in to a large organization, and they have a view of just a narrow aspect of things. Obviously, we still can do things, but I don’t think it’s anywhere near as efficient as if you have people who have a broader experience base. I’m not sure I made myself clear on that, but it was sort of a unique opportunity we had, a unique time."

We had some other projects. But I found difficulty in having the small projects. On the one hand, everything has to be approved at all levels and so whether it’s a billion-dollar project or a million-dollar project, those numbers seem to go all the way up to the highest levels, and so to do a small project is almost as much trouble as doing a large one. So if you’re going to do battle for resources to do this, that, and the other thing, well, why not go for the bigger one?\\n\\n The smaller projects are a small group of people that have a good objective and so forth, but they don’t have the visibility or the resources to go all the way. They need to have representatives all up and down the line. Well, if their representatives all up and down the line have had that experience base, fine, but when they haven’t had the experience base, each project looks larger than it necessarily has to be.\\n\\n Another way of doing that obviously is to have more delegated responsibility and more freedom of flexibility where the objectives of the organization are well established by the Congress and the executive branch, but the actual implementation is more delegated. Our system is so efficient now that in the budget every little detail is listed and so whether or not this particular project goes or not has visibility at the highest levels. Well, that’s good in some respects, but it also makes it a bigger deal than it needs to be to do that particular objective.\\n\\n The other problem that I ran into was when we were sort of trying to develop small projects, everybody wanted to work on them. Oh, that looks like a fun thing, if we’re going to do that. So pretty soon you had an army of people that wanted to work on this project, which I felt like what we needed was a lot more small projects for people to work on, and then each of them could be more efficient. But doing things on a large scale is a lot more difficult than doing them on a small scale and generally a lot less efficient, so."

I’d like to see a lot more smaller projects, and then I think we could maintain an experience base and a development path similar to a unique time that I was privileged to experience in the growth of the space program.

        "utterance": "Oh, each project, I mean, it should be a competitive process to get to valuable projects that are meaningful and produce results within their own right. For example, at PARD, as I understand it, we’d gone beyond the capabilities of wind tunnels in terms of our need for information in terms of speed, if you want. So each of those projects had particular objectives to get heat transfer around a particular configuration, to get aerodynamic characteristics for support of all sorts of things.\\n\\n So, no, I’m not maintaining that we do small projects for fun just so that people can gain experience, but that’s where the real progress is made in terms of understanding, in terms of capability development. It is going on, it’s just not going on as much as I think it should go on. Part of that is because we’re so well organized. We know exactly what every individual is doing to a certain point. What we need is more of a process, in my opinion, that is competitive but gives rise to challenges. I enjoy challenges. I described a few of them that I had, unique experience obviously. I really enjoy it. I felt like I contributed as we solved each of those problems and made each of those steps. I think most engineers and most people really enjoy being challenged. That’s the thrill of life, in many respects.\\n\\n In large organizations, it’s very easy for people not to be challenged. It’s just a job. I just go to work, punch my timecard or whatever. I’m exaggerating, but that’s the other limit, as opposed to organizations, whether it be private, government, whatever, where the people are challenged. You can’t wait to get to work. The problem is to force people to also have a family life and other activities. That’s kind of where we were in the space program. We were so excited about our work, sometimes we lost perspective on more important things in life.\\n\\n But in terms of organizations and productive organizations, I personally think that it’s important for the individuals to each feel challenged and to take on greater challenges. That’s sort of the experience that we had in the space program, because none of this had been done before. You’d solve one problem, and there’s another one that either crops up or all of a sudden you’re smart enough to realize that it’s there.\\n\\n I guess I sort of gravitated into advanced programs, as they call it, relative to trying to develop technology for future things. I think probably the most fun I ever had as an engineering job was working on a solar power satellite. Back in the energy crunch days, that was an option which when you first hear about it sounds absolutely stupid, but after you think about it, it makes some sense.\\n\\n But the challenge I had or the fun that I had was doing engineering on a vehicle the size of Manhattan Island. There’s no precedent for that. No published papers about, okay, this is how you do this, all brand new. Well, it’d take a long time to go into great detail, but the solar power satellite is immense. The concept is to be, for example, in geosynchronous orbit gathering the sun’s energy, then transmitting that energy through microwave beams to the Earth, and then providing electrical power into the power grid, the advantage being that the sun is there all the time in geosynchronous orbit, with the exception of a few blinks at a couple times a year, and so you’ve got continuous energy coming into the system.\\n\\n The inefficiencies associated with the conversion are in space, so you don’t have even the waste heat associated with developing the energy. It makes a lot of sense from an overall standpoint of providing energy for people on the planet. The difficulty with it is you don’t really make money until you do the whole thing, and to do the whole thing you need to build up an infrastructure on the ground, the transportation capability in terms of rocket systems, etc. You have to build the satellite, and like all solar energy, you make all that investment up front. It has to be a massive project, and if you make some mistakes, they’re big mistakes. So the problem was, again, to have sort of prototype systems.\\n\\n But anyway, the reason I say I had so much fun with that is the system design, from a structural standpoint is one of dynamics. There are no loads. You’re sitting up there far away from the Earth, sort of in a balance in geosynchronous orbit. The solar pressure of light is significant in terms of loads. So it becomes, the system becomes what I call sort of a stiffness design. You have to point the system to the sun. You have to point the transmitting antenna to the Earth, and that’s all you have to do. So you don’t need big steel I-beams and that type of thing, but you’re covering the area the size of Manhattan Island, so it’s kind of like how do you make tin foil stiff, if you want.\\n\\n But the fun part was when you tried to explain a design or concept, and you talk in terms of natural frequencies or whatever the system. They’re outside the realm of anybody’s experience in terms of constructing things. But when you sort of back-of-the-envelope it, again, envision a system the size of Manhattan Island, okay, in geosynchronous orbit and it has to maintain its shape. Well, you’ve got beams and so forth and whatever the configuration. Well, by analogy, those beams provide a stiffness between different points, which is kind of like the interaction between molecules in a material. You take, well, something a little more flexible than a cup, I guess. You take a material and its characteristics, its modulus, its density, it’s all related to the intermolecular forces. So it turns out you can take this system the size of Manhattan Island and say, well, really the stiffness, the force between this point and that point, is due to this, and that’s kind of like intermolecular force, and pretty soon this overall system has a density, you know how much material you have, and you can calculate a Young’s modulus for the whole thing. Given the geometry, Young’s modulus, and the density, you can calculate the natural frequency. So when you back-of-the-envelope and put it in those terms, oh, yes.\\n\\n Anyway, it was fun. Because one could relate, if you want, engineering characteristics of structural features of this configuration to materials and their characteristics as a result of intermolecular forces. Again, it was a simple case. It was research in the sense of new designs and new concepts, but it was gaining an understanding. I mean, I better understood materials and material characteristics as a result of doing the design of the solar power satellite. So it’s a learning experience. Like I said at the beginning, that’s what I’ve always enjoyed is learning, gaining an understanding, and doing it because it’s something that needs to be done, as opposed to just completely academic, wanting to do it. So I had a really great time."

So I was kind of at a lull between having done that work and awaiting some measurements from the Shuttle first flights, which was also a lot of fun. So my boss asked me to help out on this solar power satellite. He said, “I’d like you to look out for the thermal parts.”\\n\\n Fine. I went to the first meeting and walked in ready to do the thermal characteristics, but there wasn’t anything to do a thermal of. There wasn’t really a basic configuration. Being completely novel, people really didn’t know where to start with this thing. I mean, there were cartoons. One fellow said, “Control is a problem, so why don’t we just blow up a balloon and that will be the configuration.” Well, that had some other problems.\\n\\n So before I could do the thermal design or evaluations or whatever, we had to have something. So I kind of got involved in what should the system be. It turned out that one of the most important features for the structure was to have a very low coefficient of thermal expansion. To do that required making composite materials and having a design that recognized—again, I mentioned before that the forces are zero, I mean, very small, but you have to deal with them for your system. If you had any shadowing, the temperature changes in space, on one side you’re looking at the sun, which is as hot as can be, and the other side you’re looking at three degrees Kelvin. So as you go from shade to exposure to the sun, the temperature changes tremendously. So the materials expand when they get hot, and they contract when they’re cold.\\n\\n So that turned out to be a significant feature to the design of the structure. The importance of that is illustrated, for example, as I understand it we went to talk to people working on the space telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope, and they had addressed that issue for the telescope, because of its very tight alignment characteristics. I shouldn’t tell on them, but the very first time they put it together and they went to test it, and they were looking for very low coefficient of thermal expansion for the entire system, and it was like ten times higher than they expected. They looked at it, and it turned out the telescope is quite large. The joint, to simplify it, let’s say it’s thirty feet long for discussion, and at one end the material’s made of a composite that has very low coefficient of thermal expansion over a range of significance, and that material is to be bonded against the base in a particular fashion.\\n\\n Well, they had put the bond the wrong way, and so the glue between the two pieces which had a normal coefficient of thermal expansion, the thickness of the glue over that thirty feet was enough to increase the expansion an order of magnitude more than what it should have been. Once they changed the geometry, then everything worked out very well. So again, the fun that I’ve had, like they had, was getting into areas where you needed to really understand what’s going on in order to achieve the objective.\\n\\n Like I said, that’s what really made it fun, and that’s why the solar power satellite was the most fun for me, because there was no precedent with it. Now, we just, we only did a concept. Obviously we’re not doing a solar power satellite, although I do think that it’s a viable option in the future, again, using this idea that we need small projects as opposed to big ones. It doesn’t make sense to argue whether or not a solar power satellite is the right thing for the country or the world to do. I mean, you need to have those discussions. You need to understand whether it’s a rational concept or not, but you’re not voting on whether or not to commit resources for trillions of dollars to do solar power satellites without having done some small things that give you a foundation, not only in terms of understanding, but also of evaluating just what the advantages and disadvantages of doing things like this are.\\n\\n For example, Abe [Abraham] Hertzberg had proposed using laser systems for efficient propulsion. As opposed to carrying the whole energy system with you, you have a local power plant, if you want, either in space or on the ground and then a laser system which focuses on your rocket, if you want, and provides the energy to heat the gas which is being expanded from the rocket, so you can, in principle, have more energy, and you can use ion engines and so forth to take advantage of electrical energy. That’s an interesting concept, which I think should be pursued for application in space, but also because the power beaming and learning about what the problems are in addition to the basic theory would help provide a foundation for an option of a solar power satellite or similar system in the future.\\n\\n You learn by doing things. We’ve kind of gotten into a mode where we talk about billion-dollar projects and we spend a lot of time debating them as opposed to having options available, if you want, for the future and smaller things that we commit and go do and are worthwhile within themselves, and then you kind of knit them together to go whichever direction you want in the future. We did that sort of by accident, if you want, in the development of the space program to where we are, but now we’ve become so efficient that we’re kind of losing sight of that process, if you want.\\n\\n I don’t mean to be so critical of things that are going on, but looking at back on your career and seeing—well, when you’re an old retired guy, you look back and remember the good old days and so you’re critical of what’s going on today, but everything is balanced."

Even though that’s the hardest step, you also need systems out in space. So again, you kind of have to look down the future to see what options you might want to pursue, and then I would maintain that we do things that are good within themselves but also can be justified in terms of building a foundation for things that we might want to do in the future.\\n\\n Now, there are some smaller projects in the unmanned space activity, so-called robotic activity, and I think those are great. When you look at a rocket equation, the smaller you can make the payload, the faster you can make it go, particularly with the miniaturization that we’re doing today and what we’re able to accomplish at a small scale, boy, we need to take advantage of that in our space exploration, robotic as well as human. I mean, within NASA, within the space activity, we’re all working for the same fundamental objectives, and we’ve sort of divided things into robotic and human exploration, and that’s appropriate, but I think our activities need to be meshed a little bit better.\\n\\n For example, there are a lot of small projects in the robotic area that provide an experience base for people, again, an analogy with the PARD and the Mercury and Apollo and Shuttle, a little more cross-fertilization of people for getting the experience base to go on to bigger and better programs as they are needed, I think is very good. Also from an understanding and technology standpoint, I think we need a little bit more cross-fertilization.\\n\\n When I look back on my career, I just fell into a wonderful time, had a lot of fun."

        "utterance": "I had no experience in managing contracts. I’ve never really had a contract management experience, period, other than that AVCO effort, and that was a fairly straightforward one. You could write down in a couple sentences, here’s what we need. They were the experts, and they told us everything they were doing, and we either agreed or disagreed with it. If we disagreed, then it may not happen, but they were able to pretty well explain everything that they were doing.\\n\\n I spent a lot of time up there with the shock tube facilities. I had just come out of college. I knew nothing about the shock tubes. I’d done a little work on high temperature gasses, molecular gas dynamics. I knew nothing about contract aspects or anything else. It was very simple in those days. We really just would write a letter and say do this work. We didn’t have reams and reams of paper associated with it, or if we did, they all got filled in later.\\n\\n AVCO, like a few organizations, they had—don’t hold me to the numbers—but they had like on the order of 300 people, fifty of them were senior scientists, engineers, whatever. The management structure was three people. It was a committee. There were three committees. Each committee had a head. Every one of the fifty researchers or engineers basically had to defend their projects and what they were doing to their particular committee. The committees were disciplinary committees. One of them, as I recall, was entry technology. So they had technically very good experts. [Art Kantrowitz] had given them a very efficient management organization, no structure at all, capable people, and they were driven and challenged just like people working in the human space flight program to get a man on the Moon.\\n\\n But the contract management was we all needed this information, they had facility and they did the tests and they talked with us in terms of how they were doing it and explained to us how they did it, and any questions or problems that we had with it, obviously we made note. It wasn’t a “I go tell them what to do.” They were the experts in the phenomena. They were the experts in the facilities. They had the expertise.\\n\\n Now, we also had expertise at NASA, but we didn’t have the facilities that they had. People at Ames and at Langley pushed their facilities to the limit to get the best information that we could. We all worked together.\\n\\n One of the major reasons Apollo was so successful is of the 300 or 450,000 people, everybody knew what the objective was. If my job was sweeping the floor, I knew that if I didn’t do a good job and there was some dust that got into some sensitive equipment or whatever, a rocket might fail, okay? So I did a good job at what I was doing. Well, people at AVCO were the same. They were supporting the race to the Moon, if you want.\\n\\n We had a legally binding setup, whatever that was, but I didn’t know anything about that. I was the engineer. There were other people that worried about the contractual aspects and the financial aspects and everything. I, to this day, know nothing about how that’s done."

        "utterance": "But again, having a little leadership at the top in terms of this is the objective and having that clear to everyone makes for a good project. The same thing relative to the research, if it’s clear what the objective of the organization is and NACA and its contribution to NASA, also to aeronautics, unbelievable. But common shared objective, whether it be in a research lab, whether it be in a government or private industry or in a production facility building airplanes or whatever, each person or each organization had their objectives, and they were consistent.\\n\\n So it wasn’t so much, at least my impression today is, we put together these major contracts. Frankly, as I said, I really do not understand that whole system. My bag has been the technical aspect of things. But let me just give an example.\\n\\n On the Shuttle, the contractor did work obviously in defining the environment for every body point on the Shuttle vehicle. Okay. Well, the contract people worried about, well, how do we know that they really did that and what do we pay them for? Well, the agreement was they deliver this data book, kind of like the Congressional budget, a big pile of paper with numbers on it. So there it is. Oh, okay, now you get paid.\\n\\n I said, “Well, I don’t know that all those numbers are right unless I have a staff that does the same work, and we don’t want to duplicate it.” So to me the product is an explanation of what they’ve done and how they’ve done it. That’s basically what we did on the Shuttle. Contractually, they delivered piles of paper, said, okay, here’s the—today it would be a CD [compact disc]. But, okay, here’s all the numbers, or here’s all the whatever. But what I looked at was what’s the basis for these numbers, how did they get them, what did they do, go through the basic rational. On the NASA side we would be doing basically the same thing. We had this arrogant outlook that, not that we were smarter than anybody else, but that we understood this better than the people actually doing the work. Now, that sounds irrational.\\n\\n For example, on the Shuttle, they had to define the environment all over that vehicle, every nook and cranny, okay. I had the responsibility for the environment definition, but I couldn’t generate all those numbers. I had to understand what do we know and what don’t we know. What are the limits to our knowledge, and how do we deal with those limits? In other words, in principle, how do we do these things? I had to and the people working with me had to go through the process. How well do you know the viscosity or the conductivity or properties of a gas in the Shuttle’s lower temperatures? In Apollo, for example, at 10,000 degrees, what’s the basis for those? How do you get that information? How good is the conductivity or viscosity at those conditions? We had to understand the fundamentals. What is the state of the art? What data do we have? What theoretical assessment do we have?\\n\\n On the NASA side, we really had to understand those things in order for the environment to be defined. Now, they had to understand them also, but they had to understand them more in the standpoint of how do we handle this particular piece of geometry and this particular facet of defining the environment? We had to understand it from a fundamental standpoint and be able to carry it through to being able to generate specific numbers.\\n\\n Now, like I said, the deliverable on that was not we ran so many wind tunnel tests and it cost so much and we produced all this much paper, it was how good is that environment and have you covered everything? We couldn’t afford to say, well, make the heat shield twice as big as you need and that way we’ll be safe, because on the Shuttle that’s taking payload off. We wouldn’t be flying Shuttle if we’d done that.\\n\\n So there’s a fundamental difference between what we had to do as the NASA or government side of things versus what the industry was doing. Well, there was overlap, but there’s a fundamental difference. Sometimes that difference is overlooked. The need for having people who truly understand what’s going on sometimes is overlooked, and that’s when big failures occur.\\n\\n Like I said, I think that fits with what I started with here in terms of I was searching to do some research and have some understanding. Now, I haven’t developed a new relativity or anything like that, but I’ve had a lot of fun, as did all the people working with me that I worked with. It was a fun time. It really was."

I knew nothing about the details of the contract. I was just focused on the work and the product and getting what we needed.\\n\\n The management was casual. It was kind of like a family or whatever. People didn’t care what their titles were. None of us were in it to make money. I mean, I thought I mentioned, maybe I didn’t, but when I came to work for NASA, that was half the salary I was offered for a different job. Everybody that I knew could be making a lot more money, if that was their objective, doing something different. Our objective was to explore space and put people on the Moon and develop a Shuttle system, reusable system. So there was a management structure there as required. It wasn’t as loose, for example—I shouldn’t say loose. There was more structure than the AVCO system that I described, but it was a lot bigger organization.\\n\\n But particularly in the engineering side of the house, what was important was the product, the basic information, and understanding so that the proper decisions could be made. The decision process was very open. It wasn’t, okay, we’ve considered all your input so we’ll get back to you in a week as to what we decide, the decision was made right there. Based on these inputs and our understanding, this is the best thing to do right now and this is why. If somebody, it didn’t matter who, in the room said, “But you overlooked,” they’d stand up and say so, and the project manager or the supervisor or whatever would say, “Oh. You’re right.”\\n\\n Now, that doesn’t say that people didn’t get angry, but they got angry about whether or not the right thing was being done. They didn’t get angry at each other very much. It was an ideal organization. It really was. Not that there weren’t problems. I mean, certainly there were problems, but my overall recollection was, boy, everybody’s head was screwed on right. You kind of all had a common objective, and there wasn’t anybody out to build an empire or do other people in or back stab or whatever. At least if there was, it wasn’t visible to me."

        "utterance": "Well, I had a good basic education. In fact, I mentioned that I was going to graduate school while I worked for NASA. For me, that was an ideal. I would go in to a class in molecular gas dynamics, graduate class, and most of the students—we were all peers—I was actually using the stuff at work. So if the professor—or addressing books or the professor’s going through something, I immediately knew what was important and what wasn’t important, because I was trying to solve a problem that used that.\\n\\n So it developed with time. I mean, initially I was interested in gas dynamics. I’d done a little bit in nonequilibrium before I came to NASA, and I mentioned the nonequilibrium radiation. That was exciting, but I had a foundation, and I just learned as I went.\\n\\n With the environment on the Shuttle, in order to do the radiation, I had to understand the flow field, so they were married. I had to understand the fundamental aspects of convective heating and what was going on, because when you get to those high temperatures you begin to question whether or not you’ve got the right equations. The physics is correct, but the equations get a lot more complicated very quickly. So it was a combination of studying and the work that had to be done. So it, my knowledge, if you want, grew with time.\\n\\n Again, I don’t mean to harp on something, but the idea of you don’t just hire an expert to come in and do something. The best expert in the world, if you’re a real expert, you’re generally fairly focused, and each problem is different. To bring the expertise to bear on the appropriate problem, there has to be communication in terms of what the real problem is, in addition to the required expertise. There were times when we had a massive problem, Apollo 13,\\n\\n Challenger\\n\\n . We had big problem on STS-1 with overpressure. The agency would pull in the best expertise, and you had a combination of the best expertise and the people who were familiar with the system or whatever elements of the problem were. It was kind of a race as to who figured out what was going on first. I mean, I don’t mean that in a negative sense. Everybody was working together to a common objective, but both sides had to come together for understanding.\\n\\n On Apollo 13, I’d never worked in cryogenics. I really never thought about it, okay, but all of a sudden we had the incident with Apollo 13. My boss, Joe [Joseph N.] Kotanchik was running around saying, “Hey, we’ve calculated it would take so many pounds of dynamite to blow that tank up, and all there is is millivolts going in to this system, where does the energy come from?”\\n\\n That’s a good question. So we started thinking about it. Now, there were people who knew what was important. I mean, the design of the oxygen tank involved a fan or circulating system because when you’re in low g, well, if you light a match in this room, it heats, but you have like a candle flame, all right? Because of gravity, the hot air rises and the cold air falls, and so there’s mixing, so it never gets any hotter than the flame, obviously, that’s the source, but that’s spread over the room in time. In space, you have essentially low gravity, not moving, you’ve got this cryogen, if you have an energy source, it heats locally, but there’s no free convection because there’s no acceleration or gravity field. So what happens? It gets hotter, and in the cryogen you form a little gas bubble, if you want, and that gas bubble just continues to grow. So with very little energy, you can create very high pressure in low gravity.\\n\\n Well, the people who designed the tank knew that. They had put in a fan circulating system so that it would circulate things and you wouldn’t run into a potential high pressure rise. They knew that in the design. But that information wasn’t readily available to everybody. Well, I had never worked in cryogenics. My guys had not worked in cryogens, guys and gals had not worked in cryogens, but here’s this where did the energy come from? Well, we figured it out in an afternoon and made some hand calculations, which were an order of magnitude off because of the difficulty working at the triple point.\\n\\n But in any event, I forget the question now, but the point was that you have to drive to understand the fundamental—oh, it’s communicating between. There was an expertise relative to constructing those tanks and how they were designed. A problem occurred. It didn’t have anything to do with the design, per se. It had to do with the handling of the tank, as it later came out, but the question of immediate concern is what happened? How bad could that damage be, and where did the energy come from? Well, we were able to figure that out in an afternoon, not having any background in cryogens or anything else, but understanding basic fluid mechanics and heat transfer and with the information that we had. So it’s not just having the basic expertise, if you want, it’s also understanding the problem, and it’s bringing those two together, and that is just pretty fundamental."

In fact, the whole program, I didn’t hear it directly, but I was told that after the first successful landing on the Moon and return, Bob Gilruth is supposed to have commented that, “Some day they’ll try to do that again and they’ll realize what an amazing accomplishment it was.”\\n\\n It was a very complicated system, but we had an approach that basically made sense. The only thing we really did, that I remember, without testing it first was the actual lunar landing. I mean, I mentioned the 501, 502 vehicles that were fired into. I mean, they were command modules. They were on an entry trajectory. They went through that environment just like eventually the men would do. We had 201, 202, which were orbital returns, that went through the entry environment before the people did. Everything we did, we tested to make sure it would work without risking a human life before we took that step. So even though Apollo happened quickly and it was risky, we had a good, rational approach in terms of how we did things. I mean, it’s not just at the overall vehicle and system level, it was right down to the nuts and bolts, the same kind of basic approach. We had a tremendous advantage that resources were not really a constraint. But unfortunately we did it quickly, so we can only spend so much money. The objective was not to spend money, the objective was to put people on the Moon.\\n\\n But relative to Apollo 13, well, I think, for example, I don’t remember precisely how quickly things happened, but we had a team. I mean, there was an operations team that were immediately supporting the crew. There was all kinds of supporting teams in terms of what happened, what problems, what other things might happen. There was a high-level investigation team put together very quickly, also. They all worked together.\\n\\n On the investigation team, Hans Mark, who had just become the director of Ames, was on that team. I think I discussed before we had made a calculation saying, hey, here’s where the energy can come from and just really communicate. There were other people that were more expert at that than we were, but we happened to be there and did the analysis.\\n\\n Well, this fellow in the back of the room kept asking me probing questions, like I knew what I was talking about. He came up later. Well, it turned it was Hans, and he wanted to go to the lab and do some tests. He was a center director. But that was what was important at the time, not how is the budget doing and where are the projections for this, that, or the other thing, but what happened on this vehicle?\\n\\n I’m reminded of STS-1 and the overpressure. We had a nice successful launch. This is on Shuttle. It had some measurements made on the back of the vehicle that all of a sudden people realized the accelerations were a little higher than they should have been, local accelerations on the structural members, and pressures were much higher than anybody expected, like a factor of ten higher overpressure than they expected. I had not worked on overpressure. But the question was, well, what’s going on here?\\n\\n We almost lost that first vehicle because there wasn’t an adequate understanding of the overpressure phenomenon. I think everybody had done a reasonably good job, but there really wasn’t an adequate understanding. The overpressure had been characterized for missile launches in silos, which you’d think would really be a bad situation, and there had been papers published characterizing overpressure.\\n\\n Shuttle came along and went through those solid rockets, and they’re virtually a controlled explosion. They start so quickly that the exhaust coming out compresses the air in the vicinity. It’s sort of like a piston coming out compressing the air. There had been some work done for silo launches, missiles, and the data was correlated, and that was unfortunately accepted as an understanding. It was an empirical correlation, which was the best that was available, but the situation was a little more complicated than that. With Shuttle, we saved lots of money. We used the launch facilities that had been developed for Apollo. Why build new facilities? It made financial sense. But the exhaust ducts were designed for the Saturn. We’d configured all kinds of stuff to do it for the Shuttle, had to rotate the Shuttle after we launched, etc., but we saved money in terms of not building a new trench and putting in new concrete.\\n\\n Turned out that the geometry was a very important factor in the overpressure, and the geometry had not properly been accounted for in terms of the phenomenon. It was a big mystery. Where did all this pressure come from? But really, an almost back of the envelope analysis in terms of, as I mentioned, it was sort of like a piston compressing the air, is it one-dimensional, is it two-dimensional, or is it three-dimensional? It turns out the scaling for each dimension is considerably different, and all you have to do is say, okay, I’ve got a one-dimensional or two-dimensional or three-dimensional piston, and all of a sudden you go from being independent of the rise rate to linear with rise rate, which was the empirical correlation from the silos, or is the rise rate squared, which was the case on the Shuttle, because it was a three-dimensional compression.\\n\\n Once we understood that, it made a lot of sense. Twenty-twenty hindsight was great. Fortunately, the structure was robust enough it could withstand that overpressure. So then once we understood it, well, what do we do about it? It’s kind of late to go dig a new trench for the exhaust. So Max Faget came up with the idea of, well, we need a barrier, but the barrier would get blown around.\\n\\n There were some tests done later to get some data, and the overpressure on the—I might not have numbers right, but in perspective—the overpressure on the base heat shield was like three psi or so above ambient. We had made some quick calculations that said pressures down below were significantly greater than that. So there were some tests done in a scale facility and then eventually on the MLP [Mobile Launch Platform]. They put in pressure gauges that went to fifty psi in the hot region, if you want.\\n\\n We said, “Well, those aren’t going to be high enough.” Sure enough, they pegged. It got over a hundred psi down there, because those solids started very quickly and it was, indeed, a very three-dimensional flow, like I said. Anyway, there was an awful lot of pressure. So if you put a barrier between the vehicle and the overpressure, that barrier gets blown away. Well, Max came up, oh, how about water? The vehicle has to withstand water anyway, and you don’t feel good if you get hosed down, but it’s not like getting hit with a brick or a flying two-by-four.\\n\\n So that idea, plus putting together his sewing team to make the troughs out of a lightweight material, came up with a barrier that is to my knowledge still being used, and that took care of it. But again, first it’s fundamentally what’s going on, and then what’s going on in this particular situation due to the geometry, the high rise rate, etc. See, the scaling was from a Tomahawk [cruise missile] size, well, a Tomahawk was a one-fifteenth scale SRM [solid rocket motor], basically, and the facility had two Tomahawks set up with a one-fifteenth scale orbiter and ET [external tank] and MLP and all that. At one-fifteenth scale, it’s 225 times if you square it in terms of what’s going on. So that would make pretty refined measurements and scale those up. Who would think that you’d multiply by 225 or by a factor of ten instead of a factor of three in terms of the rise rate correlation? But that’s what it turned out to be.\\n\\n But you have to understand fundamentally what’s going on in the application and then, and Max really was the one that came up with the idea of the water troughs, how do we deal with it in a practical sense. There wasn’t much time, at least we wanted to have a second launch in not too long a time."

        "utterance": "Oh, yes. I mentioned that we had a pretty efficient design on the thermal protection system. Normally one thinks of the windward side, where all the high heating is. There’s a lot more area on the lee side, and even if you put just a little thermal protection system over that large area, it’s a significant weight, so tremendous pressure to reduce that to be minimum. Max used to joke, “All we need is a coat of paint,” because on the Mercury and Gemini configurations, there was a lot of weight on the thermal protection system in the separated region, which in hindsight wasn’t needed but it was very hard to determine because the wind tunnel really didn’t simulate the entry conditions that well. Even if it did, it was very difficult to measure in a wind tunnel these very low heating rates and correlate them. It’s actually more complicated than on the front side.\\n\\n So he felt very strongly and most appropriately, in fact, he told one day, he said, “Bob, I want you to burn at least a small hole someplace on the lee side.” Well, as close as we came was the OMS pod, and again that was the difference between the wind tunnel condition and flight condition and the nature of the flow. That was beyond our computational fluid dynamics before we flew. We just about got there. Plus there was also a combination of, again, a lack of simulation capability. We needed the heat, if you want, the hot environment, as well as the pressure. It was a combination. Didn’t actually happen at peak heating, it happened a little bit after peak heating, the scrubbing action at the higher pressure. Pressure continually increases as you come in.\\n\\n The other thing, well, the lee side of the vehicle is still a challenge for any vehicle, even for a simple configuration, because on the windward side of the vehicle, one can pretty much assume an adiabatic flow, that is, the kinetic energy of the gas comes in, it’s converted into thermal energy, and you basically retain that energy.\\n\\n On the lee side of the vehicle, it’s a big wake region, and the gas that’s there is there for a long time, so it actually gets cooled. It’s not an adiabatic flow situation. It’s far more complicated, even for a symmetric simple configuration today, plus it’s unsteady. The flow is unsteady. It can be done, but it’s still a real challenge to predict heating accurately on the lee side of a vehicle or in the wake of a vehicle.\\n\\n The environment, as I mentioned, is very small or low compared to the windward side. So it’s a challenge of a little bit over a large area. For any real configuration, you have local hot spots where the heating can be significant for a short period of time or significant just at a particular angle of attack, a particular Mach number and all that, and you go through a complete spectrum. Getting the resolution and the understanding of that is still a challenge today, frankly. So we did damage some TPS on the OMS pod, which we then beefed up with some tiles, and that was fine.\\n\\n Relative to losing tiles, if we lost enough tiles in the right region, we could, indeed, lose the vehicle. On the other hand, we also had computed if we lost a tile anywhere, we would not lose the vehicle, not because of the thermal protection system, but because we used an aluminum structure and aluminum has a tremendous conductivity, which is great. It’s hard to weld. You can weld steel easier than you can aluminum, even though the aluminum is a much lower temperature because it’s got just a good conductivity compared to steel.\\n\\n Well, that was a very good choice for material for a thermal protection system, as a structure under the thermal protection system, because if there was a local failure, the conductivity of aluminum basically saved you. So we were not worried, actually, about a single tile coming off. We were worried if we lost more than one tile in particular regions in areas.\\n\\n Also what was of concern was the flow between the tiles, the gaps, which were later stuffed significantly. Again, the flow gets a little bit more complicated as you get to a greater level of detail. It’s one thing to compute the environment over a simple configuration, another step to get the environment over a complex configuration, both empirically in a wind tunnel as well as now with computational fluid dynamics. It is a third level of significance or difficulty to get the flow between the tiles and the associated heating and the associated thermal relief of that heating.\\n\\n On an exterior surface, the tiles can take extremely high heating rates and reradiate the energy, and the way they get rid of the energy is to radiate it away. In between the two tiles, they just radiate back and forth to each other, so there’s no heat lost, and they’re very poor conductors. So a little bit of heating between the gaps, and the temperature goes real high. The temperature goes real high, and the gas stays real hot. Ordinarily the flow in the gas would be nonadiabatic, that is, a little bit of gas comes in, it’s hot as can be, but it’s cooled by the surfaces of the thermal protection system or the tiles. It’s a complicated problem. Plus the geometry is such that the flow-through through those tiles is affected not only by the overall flow but the pressure distribution in terms of if you want sort of like a leakage. The worst thing you can do is to punch a hole through the vehicle that would allow gas that’s very hot to flow through. That just is a catastrophic situation. So having the whole thing sealed is extremely important.\\n\\n Stuffing the tiles was our approach to not being able to understand the flow between the tiles in coupling with the complicated geometry of the orbiter and the fact that the tiles all have to fit together. Today, with current computers, we probably could do an even better job, although each tile would be unique, and then you get into the practical problem of if you drop one tile, it’s unique and you need a replacement for that whole tile, so you need complete ship sets for those things. The practical problems that they these get complicated pretty quickly.\\n\\n Another thing that we learned with the Shuttle is what does it cost to do things? A congressman comes down and says, “Where’s all this money gone?” Well, they show him a vehicle. He looks at the vehicle and said, “Oh, boy, that’s an expensive vehicle.” Well, the actual vehicle didn’t cost hardly anything. The money went into all the people who are employed to do the design, development, and everything else, but you have this image of that vehicle.\\n\\n One of the objectives of the Shuttle program was to reduce the high cost of launching things. Saturn was very expensive. So we wanted to make it as reusable as we could, which is a good objective. You build this expensive piece of equipment and then you throw it away. That’s costing a lot of money. You’ve got to go buy another one. Well, the problem is that unless you’ve got a fleet, you’ve got sort of unique hardware, so each piece of hardware is maybe not custom built, but effectively custom built, and so it in itself is expensive. So if you throw them away, they’re expensive, but if you don’t produce them in mass production, they’re also expensive. We learned that there’s probably a nice optimum in that curve which is not completely reusable, but our objective was to have it as reusable as we could.\\n\\n The tile systems were highly criticized because there’s so many parts. It’s not metal, like God intended. It’s a ceramic, and that’s brittle. It’s a glass you can break, but it went to high temperatures. At the time of development, it was the only thing that possibly could have made the Shuttle fly, to tell you the truth. Now, we’ve extended the capability of tile systems, and metallic systems have also been developed, and I don’t know what’s best now, but at the time I think what we did was probably the only way we could have gotten there.\\n\\n Your question was? I’ve forgotten your question now."

        "utterance": "The tiles got a lot of flak because it was different and new. Airplanes are built out of metal, but they don’t have to come back from orbit. They don’t have to experience that severe environment, which, unless you’ve designed one or gone through it to a certain point, you don’t really fully appreciate.\\n\\n A lot of concepts that people have in their mind is based on their experience, and sometimes they’re good and sometimes they’re not good. There are a lot of people who feel like they understand high speed hypersonic flight, and they look at biplanes and say, “Well, they go slowly, and they have straight wings. Then you go a little faster and you sweep the wings, so obviously in you travel hypersonically, boy, you’ve got to really sweep those wings because you’re really traveling fast.”\\n\\n Certainly for missiles that have to penetrate, they indeed are penetrators through the atmosphere. But spacecraft that you want to bring back, the job is to brake the vehicle from its orbital velocity of 17,000 miles an hour to landing speed. It’s not something that you fly around and try to get from San Francisco to Paris in a short period of time. You’re trying to dissipate energy. So even though the Shuttle is not as slender as, for example, a jet fighter, it’s certainly a slender vehicle compared to a capsule.\\n\\n But a lot of people never really understood how a capsule worked in terms of atmospheric braking. The idea is to dissipate all that energy in order to land. With the Shuttle, to make it reusable, we had to fly it at a high angle of attack, so if you want, conceptually it looks like a capsule coming in when it’s being heated, and then it has to tip down to be able to land like an airplane. That’s quite a challenge.\\n\\n But the point being relative to your question, airplanes are made out of good, solid metal. They have to be very efficient structures, and they can withstand certain types of loads, and some types of loads they cannot withstand. By analogy, in terms of thermal protection, you have to be able to withstand high temperatures, and metals are good at a lot of things, but they can’t absorb all that energy. So tiles were a good design and are a good design, but they weren’t understood by a lot of people without the expertise in that area, but expertise in comparable areas. So tiles got a lot of bad press.\\n\\n Plus, they were expensive to make each one, and we weren’t making them for a fleet of more than four vehicles, so I mean it was mass production in terms of making tiles, but because of that aerodynamic shape of the Shuttle, there are a lot of unique tiles. So they were expensive, but they could do the job.\\n\\n Today we have not only extended the material temperature capability in the tile system design, as well as better understanding the environment and how to fly vehicles and so forth, but there’s been a lot of understanding in different areas that make the job a little easier. But building something with today’s technology, building anything less than half-scale Shuttle would be a tremendous challenge. In fact, there have been attempts that haven’t gotten too far, which we were well aware of in terms of the difficulty.\\n\\n It’s been a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it. I learned a lot. We just scratched the surface. We still have an awful lot to learn. I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow, none of us do, but putting a man on the Moon, putting a space station in orbit, by analogy, for the Polynesians, that’s like putting their toe in the water. I mean, the solar system is big, the galaxy is immense, and the universe is much bigger than that. I have no doubt that some day we’ll be putting a base on the Moon, that we’ll be going to Mars, and probably beyond that. Certainly I’d like to see the robotic systems really press the frontiers.\\n\\n But when, I don’t know. I once read that after major significant accomplishments it takes like fifty years until you have another one. The first transatlantic cable was laid in year X. Everybody thought, wow, that’s great, but it took fifty years before people really started to take advantage and use them and they laid the second one. We’ve done some pioneering things in the space program, but it looks like it will be a little while until we push the frontiers again, the way things are going. But I’m convinced we will.\\n\\n But again, getting back to pushing for small projects, I think it’s academic to argue about the big major programs until we take some steps where we learn more, put some more robotic systems on Mars and on the Moon and find out indeed if there’s water on the Moon or on Mars. Well, we used to know what moons were. We had one, and we looked through even a Galileo telescope and we’d see other planets that had moons, so they had moons just like ours. It wasn’t until we sent systems out and started taking even pictures of these things that we realized, gee, some of those moons are a little different. Every time we get a little information, we learn something, and there’s an awful lot to learn, an infinite amount in space. What we do in the future is anybody’s guess, but we have to be taking steps and opening our options, in terms of what we might want to do, and not worry so much about—well, we have to worry about dollars, obviously, but we spend a lot of time arguing about how much this cost and how much that cost.\\n\\n I don’t think people are challenged enough today. I really do think that in the good old days we were more challenged, and people have gotten into—well, not people but organizations have gotten people into boxes where they’re not challenged. You stay within your box. You have this job to do, and you have an input, and you take that input, and you have an output, and if everybody does their thing, the whole thing works.\\n\\n Well, that’s fine to a point, but people don’t advance, the organization doesn’t advance, and things don’t get accomplished beyond the routine. We’re getting a little too routine about how we do business. I think we need to shake things up a little bit, have some challenges, and not worry so much about trying to get more money to do things but rather how do we produce more with resources that are available, change the system a little bit. But that’s easy for an old retired guy to say."

Are you constantly evaluating data coming back from the Shuttle?"

        "utterance": "No. From the fifties on there was a lot of attempts, both in ground facilities and in flight facilities or flight testing to get basic data, better understanding. Fortuitously when we flew the Shuttle, we got probably the best data ever obtained and probably far beyond anybody’s expectation due to unique circumstances of the tile systems and the instruments that were onboard. The initial flights were well instrumented. You got a fantastic amount of data, and it taught us an awful lot, not only at the basic what’s going on, but at more and more detailed levels like I was describing before relative, for example, flow-through gaps, catalysis factors that affect the heating. In other words, it’s not just a gas and the heat transfer, it’s the surface and what it does chemically as well as obviously mechanically.\\n\\n I thought we would be in a development process for vehicles that go beyond low earth orbit at this point, and that’s why we were working on transfer vehicles, how does one design a reusable transfer vehicle? In other words, from an aerothermodynamic standpoint only, we’ve got a Shuttle. We can improve on it. The next generation system can be a much better design, because we’ve learned a lot. If we want to come back from the Moon or from geosynchronous orbit with an efficient system, a reusable eventually, we have to understand that environment much better than we do. So there are a lot of challenges there.\\n\\n I mentioned the computational fluid dynamics. In the ascent environment on the Shuttle it was not precisely what was predicted, and it really wasn’t understood. The best simulation on the ground facility could not duplicate the aerodynamic characteristics. Now, they’re a small factor in ascent. Most of the factor is the rocket engine and the thrust, but in any event the aerodynamic performance was not exactly what was expected. We had a fellow that investigated—a lot of people, but one fellow in particular, and he found that the more detail he put into the geometry, the closer he got to the data, in other words, as you got to each nut and bolt, almost, in order to explain the aerodynamic drag and forces on the vehicle. So there’s no limits to what you need to do to get to a more refined or improved design, a more efficient design, even at the low speeds. At the higher speeds you get into phenomena we haven’t dealt with before, so there are a lot of basic questions.\\n\\n Also, going into the Mars, Mars does not have air as we know it, oxygen and nitrogen. It’s got a different gas. Those characteristics are significantly different, not only from transport property standpoint, also from a standpoint of the radiation characteristics. Radiation is a lot more important in the Mars atmosphere than it is in the Earth’s atmosphere. Every time you go into a different atmosphere, it’s a whole different ball game, and new fundamental questions come up.\\n\\n But you’ve got to be going and doing things. If you wait and say, “Okay, well, some day we might go to Mars,” all of a sudden there’s not time to treat the problems adequately, and so you have to be conservative in the design, and that really costs you in the long run in terms of what you can do. Not only that’s assuming that everything goes well, but in terms of the risk. The more you understand, the less risk you’re taking.\\n\\n But even though my reputation is an aerothermodynamicist, I don’t limit myself to aerothermodynamics. We discussed the structures work I did on solar power satellite. I’m just representative of the engineers that we have at NASA and probably engineers anywhere and people anywhere. A good challenge is worth the effort. So I don’t limit myself to the box of being an aerothermodynamicist. I had a lot of fun in that box, but I sure don’t confine myself to that box.\\n\\n I mentioned before about more of a union between the robotic activities and the human exploration. What unifies them, if nothing else, is the technology and how you do business, how do you do things, and your understanding of what you’re having to deal with. We would like to go on to put a base on the Moon, learn more about the Moon. We’d like to go on to Mars. We’d like to go on to Europa and better understand that unique moon. Is there life there, whatever. There are all kinds of fantastic challenges.\\n\\n I don’t blame anyone for this, but we should be addressing those challenges instead of arguing about what the next billion-dollar program is going to be. We ought to have activities that enable the people who can contribute to those challenges and getting an understanding be able to do it by, if you want, delegating responsibility a little bit more. I’m hopeful that our new administrator and deputy administrator will be able to do that. With all the things going on in the country, I hope that there will be a little better perspective for the need of delegating and not thinking that the one person at the top can do everything and tell everybody else what to do. The system doesn’t work that way. Whether it be space program or energy business, it doesn’t work that way.\\n\\n But the thrust of your question is where do we go from here or what happens to all old aerothermodynamicists? I don’t know where we’re going from here. Hopefully we’ll get to a little bit more efficient organization where people are more challenged, and I think as a result the concern about costs can be dealt with up front instead of in the back end. So I’m very optimistic about the future. But there are some bumps in the road. We have to learn some things the hard way.\\n\\n Like Guy Thibodaux said, “You’ve got to allow people to make mistakes if you’re going to advance,” and we’re just not making enough mistakes now. We’ve got this concept that we don’t make mistakes anymore. Everything is perfect. We now have computers, and they can figure everything out for us, so we don’t make mistakes. We certainly need them to work with us, but if we’re not making any mistakes, we’re not making any progress, and so I think we’ve been too concerned about making mistakes and not having a system set up where you allow people to make mistakes but little ones, so that you don’t make real big ones.\\n\\n A lot of exciting opportunities with space station, working with the Russians, I think, and all of our international partners, I think is fantastic. I mean, to the Russian people their space program represented the epitome of what their country could do and what they could do, and truly they have been very practical in what they have done. They have had tremendous accomplishments, and particularly for their economy and their system, they work wonders. Working together with them I think is great. I think that’s where the focus ought to be, working with the Russians, as well as all of our other international partners.\\n\\n But there are different ways of doing that. Remembering back on Apollo, that was a very sophisticated, very complicated system, and there were tremendous integration problems with it, but they were dealt with up front. You go build a rocket, we’ll go build the manned portions, and this is our interface. We didn’t try to build a rocket, and they didn’t try to build the spacecraft. They didn’t supply this, that, and the other for the spacecraft, and we didn’t supply this, that, and the other for the rocket. I’m not saying that’s the best way to do things, but what’s important is to up front assign responsibilities and delegate. That way, there are always going to be problems, but the integration can be a lot more straightforward.\\n\\n Because we have computers? I don’t know what the rationale is, all of a sudden everything has to be integrated and the same. I think space station should have been put up in about three years, period, and then we should have taken advantage of what we’ve learned and put up another one in another three years. It probably would have been a lot cheaper than—my analogy, if you want, is sort of the Dulles Airport. Dulles Airport was designed back as the jet commercial aircraft were coming into play, and boy, that was a big job. You had to take into consideration that jets were a lot bigger, a lot noisier, a lot faster. They needed long a runway, so they needed to be away from the cities. They needed to have a very efficient design, and it was very efficient on paper. But when I fly to Washington, I like to fly into Washington National, not into Dulles. It takes a lot more time to fly in and out of Dulles. The flight time, if you get the schedule everything is great, but then when you land, you’ve got to get on a bus in order to get to the terminal, and then you have to get on a bus or something in order to get to Washington.\\n\\n When I try to get on an airplane—and I’m not criticizing Dulles per se, but just using it as an example—if I go to get on the plane at Dulles, I have to go through so many different gates. I mean, to get into the terminal, I have to get on a bus to go to the right terminal, then I have to get on a bus to go to the right plane. Each time I get on a bus, it’s not load the rear seats first, it’s whoever got the bus in whatever order, that’s how they get on. So getting on and off an airplane at Dulles, it takes a lot more time and effort for me as a passenger than going to Washington National.\\n\\n The point is on paper it looked great. I mean, these jet aircraft are so big that we don’t want to pull them all up to the terminal. There are advantages and disadvantages in everything, but there’s a tremendous advantage in learning from a little experience. Obviously, I’m an old retired guy. I’m talking about experience here, but we have tried to do everything up front on paper, work it out perfectly, where then all we have to do is see all the cookie cutters and go put it together. That is the most expensive, most risky way of doing business. It’s much better to evolve and take one step at a time.\\n\\n Even though we did it quickly during Apollo and the Shuttle, I think that’s kind of how we worked, and we’ve sort of gotten away from that a little bit. Everybody knows that we’re spending a lot of money in space. Well, it’s not much by some comparisons, but it’s a lot of money, and so we don’t want to do anything until we have all the nuts and bolts in place, and that doesn’t really make sense. We need to have more of an evolutionary program that has a little give and take, if we truly want to get ahead in space and explore and do the wonderful things that we could be doing.\\n\\n So I think we need to look at the core of how we’re doing business on some things. Again, from an old retired guy who learned form the past, learned from my mistakes in the past, and maybe try some different things. If they don’t work, get rid of them. But I think we need to try some different things than what we’re doing."

        "utterance": "Yes. Yes. An awful lot of things you can do in space. You’ve got the vacuum to deal with and also play with. You’ve got primarily a very low gravity environment, which is a unique situation. I talked a little bit before about some of the fluid dynamic problems that are different. All kinds of things to learn there. Then there’s the very fundamental thing of human beings and how they function or living organisms and how they function in space. But to just put up an outpost and say, “Okay, we’re going to do all this stuff,” a lot of those things are in conflict.\\n\\n For example, if I want to do ultra low gravity experiments, I probably would benefit easiest from a free flyer that goes and does these things. The question is what are we doing and how and what makes sense and what doesn’t make sense. Trying to figure all that out in advance and go build a perfect system that will enable you to do all that is the most expensive way in the world to do it. To me it seems much cheaper to do it on a small scale, try things and learn what works and what doesn’t work, and evolve from there, taking into account that safety and human life is very important.\\n\\n My great-grandfather died in a fishing boat sinking off New Jersey back before there were regulations about having lifeboats and life vests for everybody onboard. The boat went down, and there was just no way people could make it. So we need to always remember that the unexpected can happen. We need to have capability of life vests, if you want, and lifeboats to handle the fundamental lifesaving capability. So there some principles that we need to abide by, kind of like we did with Apollo. You don’t put a man or a person into the system until you’re confident it’s going to work. That’s by having it work.\\n\\n So I’d just like to see some attempts at doing things a little differently so that we get a little bit more efficient and challenge people more. I had a lot of fun as did my peers, because we, indeed, were challenged. It was fun all the way. People are challenged today, but I don’t think quite as much at the individual level. There’s a big group challenge. How do you get 400,000 people together—well, not that many today, but however many to go do this, and I think we’d be a little better off to putting it into more bite-sized chunks. I seem to be on a theme here today. [Laughter]."

        "utterance": "Oh, yes. Yes. I had the pleasure of having a bunch of young people working for me in advanced programs, which is kind of novel. Normally you put the old folks in charge of advanced programs so they take advantage of the experience, but circumstances were such that I had the advantage of having some young people.\\n\\n It was very simple. I said, “I think we need escape capability for the space station, and I have some ideas, but I don’t have all the answers.” But the challenge I gave them, I said, “Okay, picture yourself up there and something happens. There’s a fire, a meteor goes through the thing, complete blackout, whatever, I mean, some catastrophe that we did not anticipate, and you’ve got to get out of there. Or if you don’t think you’re going to be on a station, your son or your daughter is up there. Now, give me a system that will enable them to live.” I said, “Now, for example, my idea is no computer at all. I want like a life vest or a simple lifeboat that I can jump in, punch out, and come down and have a little GPS receiver that we could locate wherever that system is and go rescue the people.”\\n\\n Now, the young people said, “No computer? You can’t work without a computer. You’ve got to have a computer to tell you where you are,” and all that stuff, and I lost that battle. However, the computer, as we refined the design a little bit, the computer had to constantly update it and you had to check the batteries or the power source or whatever to make sure the computer was working, so the computer—I’m not arguing there shouldn’t have been a computer, I’m just pointing out that I was pushing for a very simple system, and they came up with a simple system.\\n\\n There’s a problem on impact, back on Apollo. In fact, I was not involved in the structure on Apollo at all. On the other hand, one of the first tests of the Apollo impact, just dropping the command module into the water, you never know what the sea state is. The loading is pretty dramatic, and there was a congressman or somebody coming down, and we were going to have a test. What do we do with the congressman? Somebody, “Oh, we’ll show him this test.”\\n\\n One of the structures fellows had done some computations said, “You better not do that.”\\n\\n They said, “What do you mean?”\\n\\n He said, “Because it’s going to sink.”\\n\\n Nobody believed the calculation, but that’s what happened. We learned some things.\\n\\n Anyway, we had some ideas in terms of how to absorb the energy on impact in terms of the basic design. In other words, this is not a Mercury capsule, it is not a Shuttle, it is not one of these other things, it’s an escape vehicle. I think they came up a reasonable design that could have been built in-house for not that much money and replicated for not that much money. But I don’t know who took the proposal forward, but what happened was, “What? JSC has a proposal for a spacecraft. Well, it’s probably going to cost ten times what they think,” and so the price was going up by a factor of ten, which I couldn’t believe, but maybe that was good, I don’t know. Then it got through Budget Office or whatever and they said, “What? Oh, that’s probably ten times too low,” so I was up in a billion-dollar program for a simple little thing which might not even have had a computer in it, but would have served a particular function.\\n\\n I’m not saying that it was absolutely needed. I think we’ve got a good program. We’ve always got systems on board they can jump into, and there are different approaches for this. I’m not saying we have a unique answer, but I would say that each problem, to the extent that it’s unique, has a unique solution. We tend to try to adapt solutions that we have, because we look at the hardware and say, “Oh, my goodness, that’s expensive hardware,” so we try to use that hardware for other purposes. Sometimes that makes sense. Many times I think it’s erroneous, because what’s expensive is making very few, period.\\n\\n I mean, when you make a spacecraft, to make a second one, I don’t know what the price is, but it’s certainly not twice. In fact, I would guess it’s more like ten percent. So what’s the optimum? Our cost models, I think, need an awful lot of development. Not that there aren’t a lot of people working in those areas, but I think there are some fundamental assumptions that are made that probably are not right or probably can be altered significantly.\\n\\n We’ve gotten a little bit into too much tradition, too much this is the way things are done. It’s complicated, but again, I think trying some things and see what can be done differently. There are examples. I mentioned the AVCO organization as just one having a different management structure. There are organizations associated with universities or whatever that have done what are considered miraculous things. Why? What’s different? Oh, well they’re smaller. Maybe. Maybe it’s just the way they’re doing business. Maybe they’re utilizing their people instead of telling them what to do, which really, again, that’s how we put people on the Moon, is everybody understood the objective, and everybody was fighting to contribute and do something that would further the objective, and it happened and on schedule.\\n\\n I know nothing about cost models. I mentioned I know nothing about contract process, nothing about the legal aspects, but I think there’s a lot of work that’s needed in that arena, because I think there are a lot of assumptions that are made that are just flat wrong, or you can just go out of the box and change things significantly.\\n\\n But your question was relative to the emergency escape. Yes, I mentioned my great-grandfather to the young people that came up with the design, and they had a lot of fun. They learned a lot, and they came up with some good ideas. Not that there aren’t better ideas, but they did some good work."

I was thinking that over the course of NASA you’ve got this civilian agency going the space program, but you’ve also got on the military side they’re looking at they’re the ones that are doing the pioneering work in some of the ballistic reentry and then later on they’re trying things like the Dyna-Soar program and other efforts at both manned space flight and unmanned. I was wondering what sort of information exchange there was between NASA and the military in terms of their programs, particularly in the areas that you were interested in."

        "utterance": "Generally very good. If you get the working-level people communicating, the exchange is fantastic. You get a military aerothermodynamicist and a civilian aerothermodynamicist, if there is such a thing, you get them together, they can communicate very well. To the extent that that has occurred, been very good, and that exchange has been good.\\n\\n From NASA’s standpoint, the civilian agency was chartered with just open information, and the military, by definition, is not. I mean, you don’t want the bad guys to know what you’re doing or how you’re doing it and everything else. So there’s this basic conflict there. But putting that aside, I think communication and exchange has been generally very good.\\n\\n I ran into great difficulties working on Apollo in that the military wanted to classify everything we were doing because it might have application to their stuff. So I had to be very careful there, because working for NASA, my intent was to distribute information to everybody so it could be used either in aerospace or whatever industry. So it was just a different outlook and mind-set, but the cooperation was good.\\n\\n The experience base is different, and as a result you come to different conclusions, so you have to realize what the experience base is and where people are coming from.\\n\\n I think we’ve had problems from the standpoint of trying to have one size fits all types of things. You look at these billion-dollar programs again and say, “Well, can’t we use that for this other billion-dollar program” or whatever and that gives rise to—but everything is a compromise, and there comes a point where you have to make a decision. If you try to do everything, you get nothing. If you do just one thing, it’s very expensive, so you make rational decisions.\\n\\n I think [President Dwight D.] Eisenhower was brilliant in making the agency a civilian space agency, particularly as it played such a role in the cold war, where we were open and everybody could see what we were doing. I think that in itself was a big major contribution. Having the technology that’s developed open is good.\\n\\n When I was a senior in college, I would never have worked for the government. In fact, I just refused to ever work for the government. I ended up going to work for NASA, which really wasn’t the government. It kind of became the government after a while, but I’ve learned a lot since then. I recognize that there is a role for the government certainly in R&D [research and development], and there’s a role for industry, and the two are separate, and yet they need communication and cooperation and they can both benefit.\\n\\n But I also learned there’s private industry, there’s government, and there’s government contractors. They’re not exactly the same. Private industry has a customer and customer base. The government contractor is trying to satisfy the rules and regulations and the system for him to get the next contract, if you want. I mean, there’s competition, but it’s not competition across the board where the consumer is making the judgment. It’s a competition where you go through the wicket for what the selection rules are. I think there’s a confusion between private-enterprise free-competitive systems and government contractors, if you want. There’s a spectrum there that sometimes is overlooked.\\n\\n But anyway, my point being that I do feel that our government and our developed civilization has the responsibility in concert with the universities and academia to look toward the future. I’m not saying necessarily like the way Japan does it is necessarily a good idea, but I think the government does—which I didn’t recognize before I came to work for NASA that the government does have, in my mind, a responsibility to kind of push R&D of a common interest that too high risk for any individual company to invest in.\\n\\n In this country, it seems like the private enterprises are kind of eliminating their R&D activities. To a certain extent, that makes some sense for them to specialize. There’s a lot that can be done in universities, but again there’s a whole spectrum and there’s a gap between the fundamental developments and the application that NASA has kind of filled in aeronautics and space. I think there’s a responsibility that the government has in many areas to provide that type of capability, if it’s needed. Because it won’t be done by industry, per se, private industry enterprise, per se. It won’t really be done by academia. If it’s in a crisis situation, it’s the most expensive way. I think having an investment in the future and a process by which how that investment is allocated would make sense, which is a complete change from when I was a senior in college when I wanted absolutely nothing to do with the government. People are the same whether they’re government employees or private industry employees or government contractor employees. I think everybody wants to be challenged, and I think everybody wants to contribute. We all finds way of doing it, in spite of the systems.\\n\\n Well, that’s gotten a little far afield from aerothermodynamics, which is supposed to be my expertise."

When we were addressing the system we came up with, which was just our idea, the biggest problem that we had was everybody wanted to satisfy their requirements with a new system. Just to exaggerate but make a point, I was worried about a fire, a meteor, something that we did not anticipate. The medical doctors were worried about things that they could anticipate, people get sick, break a leg, whatever, and so their requirement, what they wanted was something where if somebody had a heart attack on a space station, they could put them in the ambulance and the ambulance with land at the local hospital here. That’s a whole different system and different set of requirements, which leads to a lot more complicated vehicle.\\n\\n What we had proposed was, okay, this is the simplest system you have. That’s sort of the baseline, if you want. Then you have to make a rational decision as to what sort of capability would you like to have as a function of the probability of needing it and the cost and all other factors. So the biggest problem we ran into is in terms of explaining and presenting our concept was, well, it doesn’t do this other thing. It doesn’t do that, or it won’t land at the airport, or it won’t come down at a scheduled time so that we can get to it within two minutes or whatever. It was sort of a requirements growth on the system, which is a natural process, but you need a baseline, which is kind of what we provided, a simplest system possible to do the basic job, and then it’s a question of where you go from there.\\n\\n Soyuz is an established system. It works. If you can jump in and push the button and get out, that would satisfy my requirement, if you want—not mine, but, I mean, the basic requirement.\\n\\n We always have preconceived ideas as to how things are based on our experience. I’m certainly an example of that in terms of what I’m saying right today. But we need to examine those and identify what’s the problem and what are we trying to do, what sort of capability would we like or can we afford, and not necessarily just as an entity within itself, but how does it fit with everything else that we’re doing, which is an overall organization with leadership and delegated responsibility."

        "utterance": "Okay. Well, basically what Captain REFSMMAT was, an idea that in the beginning Kranz wanted a way to help the morale of his, quote, \"troops,\" you know. He's very much a military guy. He knew about esprit de corps and he knew about morale and these things. So he and I had several meetings, and we talked about different ideas, and we came up with the idea of Captain REFSMMAT would be sort of the ideal flight controller. So I made several sketches just on desk pads, as you can see here. It's really nothing but a sketch in pencil. In some of the later ones, I actually outlined them with markers so they showed up better, but this was the first one. It was a place where people in the organization could come and maybe just jot down a thought that they had, either something sort of clever or humorous, or maybe if they were a little unhappy about something, they could let off a little steam.\\n\\n So it began that way, and people mainly from the trench started it out. Then, as time went on, we were, I think, in Building 30 at this time, and people would just happen by, and anybody could add something that wanted to. This one was the number one issue in the Captain REFSMMAT series, and we actually had, I believe, six, and then one Victor Vector that was his arch rival. In a nutshell, it let the people choose a way to maybe vent their emotions a little bit without taking it out on their buddy at work. Everybody kind of got a kick out of it.\\n\\n For example, down in Alvin there was a saloon down there that [John S.] Llewellyn [Jr.] liked to go to. I forget the name of it, but they had a buffalo down there named Buster. So one of the entries on here is \"Viva Buster.\" There are all kinds of little things that mark the time that we were in. That's pretty much it. Captain REFSMMAT served his purpose for probably a period of maybe four or five years with the different editions that we had. Then it just sort of faded away. There weren't any big, strong requests to make another one, so we just let it kind of die a natural death. That was the way it ended."

        "utterance": "Well, you know, it started out being just like any other mission. Of course, we had had now a fairly large number of both near earth orbit and lunar missions, so we were beginning to feel very comfortable that we knew a lot about the environment, a lot about our processors, a lot about our procedures and how we could work. So we were fairly relaxed in this situation.\\n\\n In this particular flight we were introducing several new flight controllers, and we actually had dual assignments on some of the shifts. I was with another controller, Bill [William J.] Boone [III], who was a junior controller. So I was on the console with him as his trainer, if you will, or on-the-job training type. Other positions had this, too. So for many of the shifts, Bill would be there, and I would come in with him for the difficult parts or what was more complicated. Actually, during the part of the accident where they discovered it, I was just coming on when the information began to come in.\\n\\n Of course, in the trajectory area, everyone more or less specialized in their own area. So we were interested in, what does this mean to us? Is it real? Of course, the systems people always had something going on. It could be a small problem or a large problem or not a problem at all, but they always had something to talk about because these vehicles were so complex. So they began to speak about the different clues and the comments that were made from the crew, and we began to look at our data to see if we could see anything, because many times, if there's a propulsion event, whether it's planned or unplanned, you won't see that immediately. It takes a little time to propagate into the trajectory. So with our radars and all, we began to look to see if we could see any evidence that would show more information about what was going on.\\n\\n Bill was actually running the main part of the console, and I was doing some of the troubleshooting with other positions to see if we could correlate information. Then Bill pretty much went through that shift where we stayed on the console. They didn't feel like they needed a trajectory person to go on this special team with Gene for full time, so between Bill and I, we spent a little time with that team to see if they had some questions that we could go away and either do a study with information in the computer.\\n\\n So from my personal standpoint, I was not in the actual heat of the battle, whereas people in the systems areas were really at the center of trying to figure out if they could make sense of their telemetry data, correlate that, was this a real problem. If so, what was the extent of it? What systems were lost? That was really what was going on in the control center. Our tone was very much of \"How can we help?\" We weren't about to fall out of the sky. We knew that part of it, but what we didn't know was what we might be asked to do in the event of an emergency where we might need to do an immediate return. The options that we had were to try to turn the vehicle around before it got to the Moon or loop around the Moon, circumnavigate the Moon, and we looked at both of those options down in the trench.\\n\\n It turns out that maneuvers to what we would call a direct abort have huge amounts of propellant, and you have to have a lot of accuracy. There isn't a lot of room for error. It's like probably—I'm going to guess ten times the size of a normal maneuver that we would do, maybe more. So with that, the errors that you can have, if your attitudes are off, and we begin to factor in also the fact that we might not know how well the spacecraft could hold attitudes or perform a maneuver or navigate or do a platform alignment, all the things that they need to do to find out where they were after.\\n\\n So the final discussions—and these went on for quite some time—ended up to say, \"Let us do something that is as gentle to the trajectory as we can.\" It would be like you driving down the freeway fifty miles an hour and you had the choice of going on up to Park Place and going around or slamming on your brakes, sliding around, and darting off in the other direction all at once. It's very much a dramatic thing to turn the vehicle around and start thrusting back toward the Earth. So a direct abort was not only expensive, but was not felt to be even a good consideration because we didn't quite know all the tools that we had on the spacecraft, the systems and that.\\n\\n That's sort of my take on the mission. As it played out and we learned more and more about where we were and what was going on, we began to have a more orderly approach to, now, what we surely should do, rather than, in the beginning, you have a wide array of different choices that you can make. You could \"what if\" yourself almost to death. After those first few shifts, you just felt so wasted because all your energy was just, \"What if we could do this,\" and, \"Let's look at four different options on this.\" So we really spent a lot of time doing studies of what's the best way in this situation to get this trajectory back.\\n\\n Another big factor that we have to take as an input is, how much time do we have to deal with? Can we spend another forty hours or can we spend another two days? Are we running out of oxygen? Even if it's risky, do we need to do whatever we can do to get back in thirty-six hours if that were possible? So those were the kind of questions. Thirty-six hours is not a real number. I'm just pointing out that for comparison of days versus hours, you have to make a lot of choices, and they don't all depend on the trajectory. They depend on the systems that you have and the condition of the spacecraft."

        "utterance": "It was equivalent to a fairly substantial maneuver. The venting, of course, was, as it turned out, in a number of directions because the attitude in the beginning was not a nice stable attitude, but they were sort of drifting around trying to figure out what was going on. So there were components of the velocity propulsion that would be in all different directions, but there were enough of those in a direction that affected the long-term trajectory that we were able to pick it up on radar. We didn't see any changes in that and were able to start measuring a stable trajectory after, say, maybe two and a half hours we didn't notice—when propulsion is occurring and the radars are taking that data in, it doesn't want to believe that you're doing a maneuver right then because this is what we call low speed or stable orbital tracking.\\n\\n For the propulsive, like when we're launching or when you're doing the big maneuver to go into lunar orbit, we had what we called high speed tracking, and it's looking for propulsion. But the low speed tracking isn't. So we began to notice when we got into a stable part of the trajectory, and that was probably several hours before everything was totally quiescent, you might say, and then we were able to see where we were from the trajectory we were expecting and what that meant for the mid courses.\\n\\n Of course, at the same time we were looking at an array of different options. A free return trajectory was a really good idea at this point because we didn't know if twenty hours from now we would be able to do another maneuver to correct back to a free return. So there were lots of discussions about the more efficient maneuvers that we could do that would not be free return versus free return, which would give you the benefit of, if you didn't have much propulsion later on, you would be in a safer condition."

        "utterance": "Well, we always had the chance that our tracking and then the maneuvers wouldn't be exactly perfect, but in a normal situation, you always have another chance to fix it. We found that the trajectory, as we began to get closer to the Earth's field of gravity, that the angle for entering the atmosphere was shallowing. Of course, in the limit, if you don't have enough of an entry angle, the vehicle could skip out. Of course, it would then eventually come back into the atmosphere, skip again, but what would happen is you would be way, way off target plus you could end up with an angle that could cause you heating problems.\\n\\n So as we began to notice this shallowing—and frankly, we had not had anything quite like this before, so we were trying to figure out exactly what maneuvers we needed to do. But again, the data that we were getting was consistent. So in the trench we sort of lived by our data. When people would say something, we'd say, \"Show me your data,\" because we had like three tracking sites and they were all agreeing, so we felt comfortable that we could correct that with a small correction.\\n\\n But, of course, the later that you wait, the tougher it is. If you could have done that ten hours earlier, very small correction. But the feeling, again, was that this was something that was not exactly nominal, not right down the middle of the corridor, but it was well within the safety range. So the feeling was that we didn't have to try to do any heroic things with the trajectory, but until it began to stabilize, we were concerned about how shallow we were really going to see this trajectory. So that was sort of the discussions that we were having.\\n\\n The tradeoff is, wait for more data, but as you wait for more data, the cost to repair that becomes more and more expensive. So at some point the flight director has to step in and say, \"Now's the time that we need to do this,\" because he knows how the systems are, he knows how the trajectory that we've been telling him about is and the condition of the crew, etc."

        "utterance": "It was never my long-term plan to become a retro. I had the section that had both the retros and the FIDOs in there. We called it the trajectory section. We had one of our controllers who was more of a senior person than the rest of us. We were probably in our late thirties; he was probably in his late forties or early fifties. He had gone through the military. His name was Jim [James E.] I’Anson. He had gone through the military and then began his NASA career after his military career. So he was twenty years behind us in terms of his age, but he had such spirit, and he was assigned this particular shift on 15. He had to have a gall bladder operation. Fortunately, we found out about this in time that I could begin training to be a retro.\\n\\n My console, the FIDO console, was immediately beside the retro console as it was. It was in the center, and the guidance was on our right, the retro was on our left. Of course, the FIDO was the team leader. So in addition to that being the section head, it was my job to figure out how to solve this problem, and I knew my bosses were expecting me to step in there and do it myself.\\n\\n We had possibly some other choices, but the way we were doing the flights and the spacing, if I had taken someone from, say, 16 and moved them earlier, it would have impacted their training, and they were, of course, involved a lot more in the planning shifts at that point. So Jim I’Anson had begun the planning process, and the shift he was on was not the most safety-related shift, I guess you would say. So I decided to take his shift. I began to train as a retro. So I had to learn things like how to do all the mass properties of the vehicle, how to use his processor, which was the return-to-Earth processor. It calculated maneuvers that would bring you, on the return leg, bring you back into the entry corridor to get exactly this right angle for the entry into the atmosphere.\\n\\n In addition to that, the retro would do the trans-earth injection maneuver, which would get you out of lunar orbit. So they did all the \"coming home\" maneuvers, and the FIDOs did all the \"let's get you there\" maneuvers, so to speak. But we all worked hand in glove. So I had seen enough of what the retros did that my main focus was to learn all the nuances and details of the this return-to-Earth processor and the mass properties.\\n\\n The mass properties have to do with the weight and center of gravity of the command module, the service module, all the contents, the propellants, consumables, drinking water, potable water, waste water, etc., just anything that can be in there that could move or the amount of its content could change. The retro had to know that. But they had it very well organized in almost like a cookbook thing. So if you knew the language and knew where to get the data, unless there was something very unusual happening, you could go right through there. So fortunately we had a fairly nominal mission.\\n\\n But we, of course, were looking for the unknowns now, since we had had the accident on 13. So our time was much more focused and not quite as relaxed to do like what-if studies when things were pretty quiet on the sleep shifts.\\n\\n So I stepped in, did the shifts for Jim I’Anson. He had his gall bladder operation. He came out of it okay and served many more missions with us. He was a good friend. We lost him probably fifteen years ago, though. He was a fine fellow and we'll remember him fondly."

Of course, a lot of people didn't really realize that we were going to be able to do this. Then as we were successful on Apollo 11 and the flights after that, except for the heightened interest around the accident, and, frankly, the accident didn't get quite the same type of interest at the time it was happening and immediately thereafter. It was like, \"Those guys had a really bad day, but they pulled it out.\" It was only until people began to look at what we did with what we had left that it was really viewed as a huge success in terms of being able to at least get the crew back and learn a lot about what we could do.\\n\\n But as we got toward the end of the program, there was less and less interest externally. I mean, for us, we were working back-to-back flights, and we didn't really have time to analyze what was going on. We knew there were a lot of things happening in the rest of the world, but they kept us hopping with the simulations and then another flight, and we would try new and more pressing things to see if we could stretch the limits of the systems.\\n\\n Another thing I noticed, being like a first-level manager, was that budgets began to shrink and be cut. In fact, I guess they really cut that program short. In the original grand plan, there were going to be more lunar flights, and they just got to a point where somewhere up in the Washington [DC] bureaucracy they decided that the program would end here and we would move on to other programs.\\n\\n It took us a while, because, like I said, we were very preoccupied with just the job at hand, but it took a while to let it soak in that this business was not as popular and unique as it was. We had experienced a high there that, you know, we didn't really realize that was the high or what was going to happen after that.\\n\\n It was a little bit sad. I hated to see the program come to an end, but I really hated to see what happened when we didn't take any steps to capture the knowledge that we had for a next time. Of course, even today, looking back on those many years ago, of course we would have many things that would be better, and our technology in many ways has gotten better, but there are many things that would be the same. I don't know how well we took steps to capture those things.\\n\\n Your project right here is an item that would have been really nice to have done back at the end of the Apollo Program when we had many of the people that we had fresher memories, we had records, many of those records. We hung on to them, and then your office would move, and you would be encouraged to throw that old stuff away, and then eventually you end up with not very much of it. So it was sad, looking back on it. It was a highly successful program, but it seems to me like at the end of it I was personally disappointed that there was not some effort to capture what we had for posterity for here's what we could use later if we ever decided to do this again."

It was a funny process they used, and the paper was sort of limp and maybe photosensitive, because after years would go by, you'd look at them and they would get fainter and fainter and fainter, but you still could read them. They lost their legibility little by little. So maybe the process wasn't that good anyway. But that would have been some good stuff to stick in a special storage vault and just keep."

In those days, we knew that Shuttle flights would be long flights, and we knew that space flight would become a lot more routine and that we could take steps where we could take advantage of the fact that a lot of parts of it were routine.\\n\\n So we came up with some ideas. One of them was called an office MPSR, and it would be like if the main control room were in this building and this were one of the support areas—MPSR is called a multi-purpose support room, MPSR. An office MPSR would have been that maybe if you worked in here, your desk would be here and you would also have information from the flight, all the information that you'd need to do your job as support in the flight control sense, but you would also have your PC [personal computer] and maybe some document that you're working on.\\n\\n In our mind, we saw this multi-tasking thing where a person could scoot over here and look at some data, support the flight director, and then look over here and perhaps work on some report that was for a past flight, some other office-type work that you would have. So that was the idea. There were several really good people that we had. Of course, again, at the top of our organization at this time was Kraft and Kranz and [George W. S.] Abbey, some of those folks, [Glynn S.] Lunney, [Clifford E.] Charlesworth, and those guys. So we were putting plans together, bouncing these ideas off of our leaders to see what they thought, and coming back to the drawing board and coming up with new ideas.\\n\\n The layout of the control center, the new control center that we have and the layout of the old control center with where the support rooms were and how many that we needed, that was the type work that we did. What type of provision would we have for the customers that would come in? The whole idea of the cargo back in the cargo bay of the Shuttle was something that we had a lot to learn on that because for the earlier programs, NASA packed most of its own experiments. It was not like most of those came from universities and scientific labs. Many of them did, but my impression is most of those came from other NASA centers that had experiments. So now, for Shuttle, we were going to change that, and we were going to accommodate paying customers who would have satellites to launch, experiments to run, materials processing, furnaces, and so and so on.\\n\\n So we needed to figure out in their MPSR area, what did they need, how much area did we need to give them, what sorts of capabilities, how would they interface with the flight control team, what data would we provide them, etc., etc. Those philosophies and support techniques and the layout of the control center is what we really did in that mission plan section."

At that point it was pretty much a concept of what will work. Many of the ideas that we had were thought to be maybe a little too expensive or a little too elaborate. So we kind of got back into the middle of the road with what was the best tradeoff for what NASA could provide.\\n\\n The other thing that we had to work with was that in the beginning, we just had the old Building 30, and that was when we evolved our plans and discovered that we needed to add a new wing on to the building because what we had, we were outgrowing. We had two operational floors, the second and third floors, with control rooms in them, but those control rooms were so tied to the old technology of a mainframe computer, blue consoles, and the type of voice communication that we had that to take that totally out and put in all the new technology would have been much more expensive than to build a new building because it was integrated into the way the building was originally built. Also, the old building would not handle the size of the new capabilities that we needed. That's sort of how we got the new control center."

What we did in the beginning, this was sort of a final product that came out of about, I'm going to guess, six months of going up and down the halls getting ideas from people. What we did originally was solicit inputs, and we got maybe twenty sketches from people with their ideas. So I sort of took the path for Gene and collected this stuff. I had a little notebook full of that. We had many shapes, as you could imagine. Some were shaped like some of the spacecraft, etc. Came up with this shape. The idea of the band across here was my idea of a way to—this was the original one, too, mission control.\\n\\n The sigma was the sign to represent science and engineering, and it was the sum of all those efforts that we would have going into a mission. Then we had, of course, the planets, the sun and other planets. This could be the Moon or other planets and then the Earth. Then we had a little orbiting spacecraft here that had an Earth-sensing—had a little cone out the bottom because we had a big program called Earth Resources. We tried to represent many of the programs. These were some of the symbols of earlier programs. Then this \"res gesta par excellentium\" [phonetic] was Gene's Latin. I think it was \"progress through excellence.\" It had a meaning like that. There's probably a definition of it in here.\\n\\n Anyway, I came up with a sketch that was very, very close to this, and Gene contacted Bob [Robert T.] McCall, Robert McCall, who was a very noted space artist, and he actually worked up all the final artwork, and we iterated with him to make sure we had everything. He did a wonderful job on it. So this patch, then, became—we had decals, we had these golf shirts, we had them on just about everything. We put them on our console documents that we used.\\n\\n Then probably about fifteen years after the original issue, part of our organization went to Gene and they said, \"You know, we really need to represent all the organizations,\" because control would represent the people in the control center. But they came upon a proposal that would change this to operations. So operations would include the planning people, the simulation people, as well as the flight controllers. So if you look at a patch today, it will look just like this, but it says, \"Mission Operations.\"\\n\\n We also had these made in the cloth patches that were embroidered, like the flight crew patches. So that's sort of the story behind that, and I wish I had brought it, I have a little notebook. In fact, if I can locate it, I may bring it to you and just let you put it in with some of your archives or something."

        "utterance": "Okay. That was an interesting program. It was little bit of a surprise to some of us in the control area when the management brought it up. Of course, we had always referred to the Russians as the \"rascally Russians,\" you know. So we weren't going to be able to do that anymore, at least when we were working with them.\\n\\n There was much planning that had to go on. First of all, I was still a supervisor in the flight dynamics and trajectory area, so a lot of my focus was on staffing, making plans for the mission. Of course, the mission was not terribly complicated in terms of comparing it to what we had done earlier. We got those plans in place, but then there were all of the group and the international planning that we had to do with the Russians.\\n\\n They formed working groups, and I was in Glenn Lunney's working group, called Working Group One, and we had many of the plans to put together. I was the lead on a document that was called the contingency plans, and the contingency plans were supposed to contain every situation that we could think of within reason and how we would react to that, what the U.S. would do, what the Russians would do, what they would do with their systems and what they would provide, what we would do with our systems and what we would provide.\\n\\n These contingency plans were, again, primarily on the grand scale of if you're in orbit and the Apollo loses oxygen, what do you do and what does that mean? Does everyone go into the Soyuz? Will they fit? What do you do with the docking adapter? That's probably not the best example, but some of them would be like what if you did not have propulsive capability to change the orbit with the Apollo? Then would the Soyuz do these kinds of maneuvers? We went through probably fifteen or twenty different contingencies, and we planned each one of those.\\n\\n Well, a lot of this that we tried to do, in those days we had teletypes. Fax wasn't quite on board yet. We didn't have anything like worldwide web so we could interact with the Russians. So it was that we had a series of face-to-face meetings. The early ones were just the higher program-level people, but then we began to need to get the working-level people together.\\n\\n I'm not remembering the exact year, but I think it was in late September and early October, and I'm thinking it was like [19]'75 or '76, our working group went to Moscow [USSR] for two weeks. Of course, the thrill of being able to travel like that was interesting. The strain and worry about going in behind the Iron Curtain was troubling. It was high profile enough that we all told ourselves it would be okay.\\n\\n But we went there and the gentleman that was my counterpart—I was the lead for NASA and the Russian lead was named Anatolia Korolev, and [Sergei Pavlovich] Korolev, that name is a very big name in Russian space. He's one of their national heroes. However, the fellow I was working with was not his relative. He happened to be the group of non-famous Korolevs. But anyway, he was a very brilliant and very well-educated engineer.\\n\\n What we found out was the comparison between the way the Russians operated and we operated was that we would have groups of people that would do the controlling and another group of people that would support them doing the planning, and then we would have computers. Other people would help us publish books, and we would have contingency plans, and we had simulators, and we trained.\\n\\n The Russians did it totally different. Their philosophy, and even today, is that they would train in an extra real space vehicle, not a simulator, which they would try to get some information out of. What we would give to someone to run a computer program for this, they would work that out in their head. They knew the orbital mechanics. They knew so much more in their heads than we had to know, and they sort of did it the way maybe [Albert] Einstein would have done it back in the forties or whatever.\\n\\n It struck us that they did not have most of the advances that you could take advantage of using computer technology. They had some computer technology, but they weren't taking advantage of it nearly the way we were. Their spacecraft was probably not fault-tolerant in every system, whereas we were used to having one or two back-up systems to our primary system in everything that was important. That was just the way NASA was. So the money that we spent for expensive spacecraft and simulations and training, and we would plan for all the different contingencies, we came into this contingency planning with a totally different expectation than they did because, frankly, the impression we got was that they felt like their spacecraft and their crew were expendable. If they had a problem and it all went away, they'd just roll another one out there and fire it up because they had stacks of these spacecrafts.\\n\\n I'm rambling a little bit."

        "utterance": "So to compare, again, the planning, I got to be very good friends with this—we called him \"Toya\" for short. He was a very, very dedicated person. All of the people in their team were members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, who were very—that's their elite scientific people. The things that we learned when we were over there in Russia for this planning meeting were, number one, we thought that their buildings looked like they were all built by amateurs. You know, you'd site down the side of a building and it was like that. Just little things. This was some of their important buildings. It's like they did not have the pride of craftsmanship that we had grown to expect.\\n\\n Then when we got into the meetings with them, we found out that I could commit \"This is the way we will do this, and this sounds good to me,\" and Toya would have to go—he'd say, \"Okay. I'll take this to my leader, and I'll come back tomorrow and we'll decide this.\" Always they had to go to the next guy up or maybe the next guy up who also had a KGB [Soviet National Security Agency] guy in his pocket or whatever. We never knew. But they were not empowered to say right now, \"We'll do it this way. Let's move on.\" That was not a huge problem. It just slowed us down a lot, and it was disappointing because I knew he was coming up with good ideas and the people above him weren't going to add a lot to that. But that was the work process that they were strapped into, and they really didn't have a choice.\\n\\n Then my translator—each working group had a translator—my translator lived in Pacific Palisades, California, and her name was Aida Taylor. She was Russian. She had an aunt who lived in Moscow. So Aida spent—when Toya and I would be working, she would be there translating for us, although he spoke very good English. But anytime we had to record anything in a document, in other words, the translators would make sure that there was a perfect, so to speak, English and Russian version that was available that corresponded.\\n\\n But what I found out was that Aida would visit her relatives in the evening after our work was over, and it was absolutely heartbreaking, the stories that she would come back with. Of course, several generations would live in an apartment. It was the job of the grandmothers or great-grandmothers to go out and do the shopping during the days and look for the bargains and that. Even these people in the Soviet Academy of Sciences could not afford cars. It was probably not even in their hope to ever have a car. They would make, in our equivalent money, like sixty dollars a week. A pair of blue jeans over there at that time cost about that. They treasured our blue jeans. They would buy them right off of you if they could, because in those days they didn't have that denim available to them or something. I took that as it was the standard that everybody in the world had blue jeans, but they treasured those. Gold and blue jeans, you had to watch that. They would try to buy rings right off your hand because of the gold.\\n\\n But the purchasing power that they had was what was heartbreaking. Here's this man who's spent his life being educated. He works in their prestigious Academy of Sciences. He makes sixty dollars a week. If he works all week, he could buy a pair of blue jeans. That just broke my heart.\\n\\n The people that got the cars and the nice homes were the people that were in the Party. So knowing that, and of course having the translator who had a relative who could tell her really what was going on, but it really was kind of heartbreaking.\\n\\n So fast forward then to working groups that we had in the U.S., because we would have one in Russia and then one in the U.S. The last day that I was in Moscow before we headed out, we had the first snow. I was staying at this hotel called the Rossia, which is a huge, huge hotel. I think it's like 6,000 rooms or something. My room looked right out to this St. Basil's Cathedral, a beautiful cathedral. So I got to see the first snow. I think it was the first snow of the year.\\n\\n It was so cold there. Being from Houston, I'm not used to the cold weather. The courtyard side of our rooms had windows that would open, and my friends and I, we would get the blocks of cheese and the little thing of wine, and we'd just set them outside the window. That was our refrigerator. In the evenings when we'd meet and talk about how the planning was going, we'd have our wine and cheese and talk.\\n\\n We always thought we were bugged. We thought the rooms were bugged, and they probably were. We didn't know if they were bugged with cameras and microphones or what. So you were never totally comfortable.\\n\\n Then when we got ready to fly out, they told us we could not take any rubles out, particularly the coins, the ruble coins, the Russian money. So of course, when we had change we'd just throw it in our shaving kit. So we all had a little bit of it for a souvenir. We got in the plane, and we're ready to take off, and then they stopped everything and they said, \"There's been a delay.\" Of course, we're all ready to get out of this Iron Curtain area. Time passed, and finally they told us that they were having to replace the shock absorber on the nose gear of the airplane because the runway was so rough that they couldn't safely take off. So that was what the delay was. We were worried that they were going to come in and search our shaving kits for these rubles.\\n\\n Anyway, it was very interesting. I enjoyed the trip over there, but it was tense, a very tense time. During the day, when you were working, you didn't think about it that much, but when you went back to your hotel room, went to have your meal and then were getting ready to go to bed, you know, you're always thinking, \"Okay, everything thing that I say is being recorded,\" or whatever.\\n\\n So then the next thing that happens is we had working group sessions in the U.S. So all their counterparts and my counterpoint, Toya, come over, and we have an area here at NASA that we met, and that was again for two weeks. Two weeks was kind of the standard. So I took it upon myself that I was going to kind of adopt him, and rather than him having to go out to eat, because I always, in those days, brought my sack lunch, so I would bring him a sack lunch. Well, I think this went on for two or three days.\\n\\n Finally, I think his KGB—there were always people that stood around, that you couldn't quite figure out what their job was, and we figured those were the KGB guys. We think the KGB guys got to him and told him that he wasn't supposed to, because he said, \"You can't bring me a lunch anymore.\" Because we would just sit down right where we were working, and we'd open our lunches up and we would talk and eat, and we did that for about three days. After that, he said, \"Well, I can't do that anymore.\" I knew it wasn't his idea, so I just said okay and I just didn't make a big deal out of it.\\n\\n The working group sessions here were about the same, except we, of course, didn't feel like we were being spied on quite as much. But always when you would go someplace for a meeting and you began to know who was working on what, you would see these guys walking around, and you hadn't seen them working on anything, and you figured it was a pretty good bet that those were the KGB guys.\\n\\n So that was how we did our pre-flight planning, was through these working groups, back and forth, back and forth. I only got to go there once. Some of our groups got to go over two or maybe three times, particularly the people that had to do the design and building of the hardware, like for the docking adapter. They had to spend more time. But for us, we got our contingency plans in pretty good shape in about two sessions and didn't have to go back over there."

Looking back on it, we think the reason was that they didn't want these people to see how different it was. That gets back into the sad part of where they were and where we were. There may have been some cases where some of the people got to go to private homes, but when they were over here both times, we tried to have functions, tried to have something at our house or someone else's house, and it never was possible.\\n\\n We had groups get together. There's a place over here on Nassau Road 1 called the King's Inn. It's got a different name now, but they had a big ballroom there. The cosmonauts and the astronauts went out deep-sea fishing one day. Then that evening we had this reception, and they brought in all this fish. So they had the little fish-fry and the hors d'oeuvres, and the Russians had supplied the vodka.\\n\\n This was my first experience with Russian vodka. I'll just tell you that it's very deceptive. It tastes very much like a cocktail, and it's very potent. They delight in filling your glass and filling your glass. I learned after this one party that we had at King's Inn that what you do is, you take the first glass and you smile and you take a sip, and then you go to the men's room and you get rid of this and you put water in your glass, because this stuff is so strong that you just have a huge headache.

That was the type of socializing that we were able to have here.\\n\\n I didn't touch on it, but while we were there, they showed us some very nice tours and dinner things in the evenings, wined us and dined us, and they took very good care of us while we were there. They took us through some old monasteries that were like 1,200 years old and things like that. So it was very interesting and educational and enjoyable. So we reciprocated by showing them parties and things here in the evenings."

        "utterance": "Well, for us, it certainly was not technical. It was more of an appreciation for what the Russians had done with what they had to work with and their personal capabilities. I appreciated that. I think what they gained was a lot of insight into technical techniques and ways that we used computers and data that they were not advanced into that stage of analysis and planning. They also got a lot of detail on our systems and plans for our Apollo spacecraft. They ran batteries; we ran fuel cells. They ran oxygen generators that burned flames, and we ran tanks of oxygen. The approaches were very different. So they got to see, I guess what you'd say, from above the table as opposed to something that their KGB people might have been able to buy as a spy in earlier years.\\n\\n But to me, the biggest thing was that people began to see that there was some grounds for cooperation and that the two countries could figure out some way to cooperate on something, because back then they weren't cooperating on very many things at a diplomatic level. Of course, I appreciated just knowing my counterpart and what he could do and what he had learned and what he could do without the fancy computers that we had. I appreciated a lot more what they were going through.\\n\\n Of course, technically, we were, I'm going to say, fifteen years ahead of them in terms of what we would do, but more than that, our philosophy was totally different. Our philosophy was, if it was the safety of the crew, we would have one or two back-up systems for everything that was important. Their philosophy was, \"We'll have one of everything and we hope it'll be good enough, and if it's not, we'll use another one.\" So it took a while to get past that very large difference in philosophy."

We needed a starting point for the flight rules, and we, of course, had not—this was a very different-type program because, for example, we didn't land in the water; we would land on runways. So we needed to have a group of people go out and establish a starting point for where would be the places we could land and then how many of these would we want to equip so that we could land. So I had a group of people that started planning for what you might call a runway landing plan for the Shuttle, and that was going on, and we were also doing the planning for evolving the actual control center itself. That was the largest part of it.\\n\\n And how we would work in the control center in detail, who would do what, how many shifts a day would you work? We were doing the planning for the overall team. So the mission plans that we had would go across the whole team, and then what we would want to do is use the technology that was coming up, but what we had learned from the earlier programs, fold that into the procedures that we would have for the control center. So that was really our main challenge there.\\n\\n About a year before the first Shuttle was supposed to launch, I was selected as a branch chief in the Flight Planning Branch.

        "utterance": "It was between the Integration Branch and that. Again, I could get a date for you, but the best I can remember, when I went there, it was the year before the Shuttle was supposed to launch. The situation was that Tommy Holloway had been selected as a flight director, and he was the chief of the Flight Planning Branch at that point. So he went away to be a flight director, and I was selected in Jim [James W.] Bilodeau's division, which was the Crew Training and Procedures Division, as the chief of the Flight Planning Branch.\\n\\n At that time, of course, we had flight plans. Tommy Holloway and John [W.] O'Neill were sort the daddy of flight plans as we knew them up to that point. But we knew for Shuttle that we were going to have do things a little differently, and we knew that we would have longer flights and much more diverse flight. So one of my first jobs was to select for a new section that was called the Ascent and Abort Trajectory Section. I selected Chuck [Charles F.] Dieterich. Chuck Dieterich had been a retrofire officer earlier, and I knew he knew trajectories inside and out. I met with a little bit of resistance there because I was bringing a guy in from out of town, rather than picking someone from that branch, but in the end it turned out to be the very best choice and the people recognized that, but it took a little while.\\n\\n The job, though, of the Flight Planning Branch, again, relative to preparing for Shuttle, we had to get together a way to do long-range plans if you were going to have a really long Shuttle flight and a way to re-plan that. What we were thinking was that we would re-plan it at night and then execute the revised plan the next day. Well, the way we had gotten used to operating before was if something changed, you did it on the fly. You re-planned it right then during the execute shift.\\n\\n We thought, because this would be more of a business as usual—that's what we thought, anyway—what we would do is we would plan at night, and if something went wrong during the day and you didn't get 100 percent of it, well, for a business-as-usual thing, 95 percent wouldn't be that bad.\\n\\n Well, as it turns out, that didn't float. It sounded good in the beginning, but no one wanted to accept less than 100 percent of everything all the time. So for Shuttle, the landing was quite different. We had some work to do there for the flight planning. The fact that the vehicle was reusable, there were some aspects of that that we were impacted by. The fact that we had a fleet of five vehicles that would be used over and over again, yet each one of those turns out were equipped slightly differently, as they got newer, some of those had other capabilities.\\n\\n I guess the one that stood out all along, the very first one, 102, was always different. Because of the way it was equipped, it ended up being a heavier vehicle and so could not carry the same payloads because of the way it was designed for some of the early testing. Anyway, our planning had to account for from flight to flight. Even though the vehicle is, quote, \"the same,\" it's different. So you had to have the right information in planning, particularly for the ascent and entry portion of the planning, because the Shuttle would be very active in some of the abort modes.\\n\\n Let me regress just a little bit on the landing sites. Every 15,000-foot runway in the world, we made a database that had every one in it. Then because the people at Kennedy [Space Center, KSC] were very involved in the landing strip there, we involved a fellow down there named Wes [Wesley W.] Branning, and he and I became co-chairmen of a group called the Landing Ops [Operations] Working Group. What we did is we worked back and forth and together to—see, KSC would supply the crash and rescue equipment and training that would go to any of the landing sites, so they had to be involved in that. We would be involved in the planning from day to day on how we would choose different landing sites, depending on what our trajectory was and what the weather was and etc.\\n\\n So in the beginning, we had all kinds of runways. The considerations were, in some cases some of the places had runways that ended right off into the ocean. There's one in Hawaii, I think. It's a nice 15,000-foot runway, but at the end of it, if you went another quarter of a mile, you'd be in the ocean. Then there was one in Spain that was like that, it had a hump in the middle of it. There were just all kinds of problems that you found out once you started looking into what these runways were.\\n\\n But we finally ended up with a series of, of course, the lake bed at Edwards, and then the primary runway at Kennedy, but then there were several others around the world that were contingency landing sites where you would say, \"If I need to go into Guam, what I'll have to do is get vehicles and a team of people flown out of Kennedy in there as quickly as possible.\" So the Kennedy people were really in the hot seat as far as making something more difficult, because they had all this equipment that they had to move around, and that had to do with the big fans that blow. Because, you know, they weren't sure in the early days what kind of outgassing you would have from these tiles and also if there were venting from the thrusters, which would be poisonous. So they had to have the right equipment wherever you were going to land. So there was that planning that we did that was brand new to the Shuttle Program because before we just landed with parachutes on the water and a ship came and picked us up.\\n\\n So that was different. The [launch] abort modes were quite different, too, because we had—and I think they still carry on the books one called return to launch site, which is a very aggressive and dangerous mode, because, actually, as the Shuttle is launching and it goes down range, the return to launch site [(RTLS) abort] would actually turn it around and drive it back to a landing at Kennedy at the launch site. No one in our group, the trench, ever felt really comfortable that we wanted to do that, because it was so aggressive. You know, it's like moving the mountain, rather than walking over to the mountain.\\n\\n Then some of them are like transatlantic, where you land in Moron [Spain] or someplace over in Europe. Again, over there, they had a lot of weather problems. So if that one is weathered in, you've got to figure out what are your choices.\\n\\n So the strategy for launch aborts for Shuttle, because it had so many capabilities, was much more complex, the landing was different. Then, of course, on orbit, it had more computers on board, more capabilities with what you could do in the cargo bay, the ways you could do EVA [Extravehicular Activity], the arm. All of these things affected the overall operation for flight planning.\\n\\n Now I'm backing away from the trajectory part that I talked about so much earlier because the flight planning really is covering everything you do on the flight. Now what we'll do is talk about how are we going to interface with these people, let's say, who have a satellite to be deployed in terms of flight planning, because their opportunity for where they deploy needs to be factored into what we're doing in the flight plan, but we need certain information from them to do the planning, and they need information from us to be able to commit to, let's say, when they do the deployment.\\n\\n Some of the more complicated ones also were like the Spacelab, where you knew you were going to have a larger crew, racks and racks of experiments that the crew will be operating some of these at different times. How do you factor that into a flight plan, and how do you make the flight plan flexible enough that if one of the experiments is not going to work, you can have the crew use their time on something else and not be wasting their time?\\n\\n So the flight planning challenge was quite interesting to me, and I ended up having that branch for ten years. We stayed a year away from the first Shuttle launch for about four years, I think, and finally we had our first Shuttle launch.\\n\\n I was a little bit of a cultural shock to the people in the flight planning area because I had been in mission operations and flight control all of my career, and this crew training and procedures group had been, for the most part, not console operator people. They had the flight activities officer, the FAO, and some of the people that supported him in the back room. That was about what they had.\\n\\n On the earlier programs, they started out with a long white sheet of paper, and they would write the flight plan, hours and hours of flight plan: this happens and then this happens next. It was not particularly computer oriented at that time. What we brought on line was the automation of putting that into a computer, having the computer help you some do the planning, but not throw all the stuff in and then the computer figures out what to do and magically throws it up. Because the Shuttle and NASA operations are so complicated and flexible, you can't let a computer do it all.\\n\\n So what we had was an interactive system with a smart operator who had the tools to be able to go in and do these plans. That was a difficult point to get past, because there were many of the bosses that would look down on this process and say, \"Why don't you just do that all automatically?\" The culture of the people was they wanted to do it all manually. Somehow you needed to get in between and have the best of what the operator could bring to the process and the best tools so that he could do the planning job as well as it could be done.\\n\\n Where I was the cultural shock is that I required them to build a console handbook for their position in the control center. Well, they had never thought of that as something that was good for them, \"them\" being the FAOs, the flight planners. But we had many meetings, and we didn't really negotiate a lot on that. I told them it was required. Maybe a year and a half or two years after we began that, which is still about a year before the first Shuttle, that began to come together very nicely, and they began to embrace that as a concept that they needed. But for about a year of that time they really didn't, and they thought I was putting upon them and punishing them because I had been in flight control and they hadn't, da-da-da. So that all worked out okay. There was just a period of adjustment there that needed to happen.\\n\\n I stayed with that branch about ten years. We saw all the early Shuttles fly, and I was the chief of that branch. Probably our greatest moment in that branch was to successfully be able to respond when there was an anomaly in the Shuttle and the people had the tools and the procedures and they knew how to respond. That was very rewarding, to see that happen."

This was something they had actually decided, I think before or early on before the mission actually—shortly before it launched."

But actually, this is a little bit interesting, but George Abbey always liked White Sands, and there was always a desire a little bit for him to want us to go that way if it was the right thing to do, of course. But it was not like you had to convince him any. I don't know if you're aware that he has two middle initials, but we all said that they stood for White Sands. [Laughter]\\n\\n I don't remember the details of what caused us to go there, but I do remember that every time we would land there, there was a lot of extra activity because you had to first of all get the vehicle back on the carrier aircraft and ferry it back to the Cape [KSC] and refurbish. Typically, in the early days, that cost you about an extra month. So you knew that your schedule was probably going to slip for that particular vehicle. Of course, then learning to get several vehicles in flow was something that was a big learning curve for the KSC folks.\\n\\n For us, what was a big part of the curve was we had to know how to configure our simulators differently for each version of the Shuttle, reflect that in the flight planning process correctly, and, of course, in the control center because we have calibration information in there that would be dependent on what the configuration is for each individual orbiter. So the idea of reconfiguring the control center became a really big deal with the advent of the Shuttle Program. In fact, we added an organization originally to a branch, and it has since grown into a division, that's a reconfiguration organization because they have the onboard software to reconfigure, they have the ground control center to reconfigure, they had the simulators to reconfigure, and that's just the big three. There's probably a lot of other small things.\\n\\n But the paperwork and the checks and balances that goes with each one of those is deafening. It's horrendous. What you put in to load those computers has to be absolutely correct, both the ground and the onboard. We had many cases where we had near misses, where we almost—we have a problem, and we would discover something that looked funny in a simulation, and we had to decide was that a simulation problem or a real flight software load problem or something else. In some cases, we would discover, even though they were testing in what they called the SAIL, Shuttle Avionics Integration Lab, sometimes a real subtle problem would make it past the SAIL testing and we would pick it up in simulations. That's scary, but it also shows that it's good to have really high-fidelity simulations that exercise every path. That's what we tried to do, anyway."

        "utterance": "Right. Right. After ten years in the Flight Planning Branch, John O'Neill became the division chief in the Operations Division for a period of time, and I was selected as his deputy. Then several years after that, he went to the directorate staff, I think as assistant director, I believe, and I became the chief of the Operations Division. I had that division for many years.\\n\\n That division was a very diverse organization. It had a Payloads Branch, it had an Operations Branch, it had Flight Planning Branch, and each one of those is quite different. So the Operations Division was really made up of several groups, each that had a large scope, but each one was focused differently. So we actually staffed three console positions from the Operations Division.\\n\\n They moved us around to many different buildings. We always felt like we didn't get the priority for getting the best floor space in Building 30 or Building 4. Many times we would be split between two buildings, which was difficult. But then they started this little building, Building 585, and our division was split between 585 and Building 17, which is the old round centrifuge building over there. So it took some work to keep the people feeling up when the organization was split out like that. But we really had talented people, and because of the work they did, it was very obvious. In other words, there was no question at all about the importance of their work. So the people all really felt good about the work that they did.\\n\\n So that job lasted [about 10 years] until I was selected as deputy assistant director for Operations. There I worked with [Brock] Randy Stone and John O'Neill. In that capacity, I mainly specialized in Shuttle because at that time we were bringing in a lot of Space Station planning. That was starting to become a really big item. We were trying to figure out in our organization would we split a particular area into Space Station and Shuttle or would we have different organizations, separate. The answer actually was different in different areas.\\n\\n In some areas it worked to have it shared. Just take, for example, electrical. If you're an electrical systems expert, do you have all the electrical systems experts that you have in this room and then half of them work on Shuttle and half work on Space Station? Well, that turned out to be better to separate them because what they work on electrically is so different.\\n\\n But trajectory, for example, was better to combine because although the vehicles and the characteristics were different, they all flew in circular orbits or whatever, according to Kepler's law. So we had to work those philosophies and approaches out in the organization.\\n\\n We began to have lots of visits from the Inspector General, wanting to know how things were going. We had enough of these investigation groups that were coming in to see how NASA was doing business, \"How is your budget?\" and etc., etc., that one of the side jobs that I took on in my job as [assistant] director was to focus all this information so that if anyone came in in an investigation group, I was supposed to get the knowledge of who they were going to talk to and about what and help that person with past experience of what we had been doing with those so that we had a consistent way that we provided information and also that when it was all over, we knew what information we had given to each of these different groups.\\n\\n I can't even remember all of them now, but there was one that was headed by John [W.] Young one time that was investigating this. There would be different groups that would be investigating either a problem or trying to come up with a solution that maybe the NASA Administrator had said, \"We need to have a way to approach this problem at all the centers. So how will your center handle that?\"\\n\\n You can see that this level of what I was doing at this point was a little broader and not quite as technical as the early days. For several years I did what they called the POP, Program Operating Plan, the budgets for the whole directorate. This was a thing that would take about two months to do. When it was all over, you got to stand up in front of the center director and present the directorate's budget. That's where you began to really appreciate how nice it was back in the old days, when, for Apollo, they said, \"What do you need? How much? We'll have it here tomorrow.\" It was so different.\\n\\n So I guess the last couple of years of my career were mainly into the business, the budgets, the overall operations of the directorate, and then focusing primarily on Shuttle as a program, particularly for the safety. We had a safety organization within MOD that dealt with primarily payload safety and how it related to the Shuttle. That was a new area, so I mothered that quite a bit to try to make sure that got established."

It was going to allow us to operate in a quite different way because we had always been very dependent on, as I mentioned earlier, the large computers and centralized. This would allow us to use a distributed computing system and PCs. The problem that it presented was, our controllers had to have extra training because they had to know how to operate the computer part of it.\\n\\n But bringing that system on line was a really proud day for me because we had seen, probably from seven or eight years before that, coming up with the ideas about what we needed, just drawing little squares on pieces of paper for what we were going to need in a control center, and now to see the control center actually open for business was really a proud moment.\\n\\n I guess seeing that first Shuttle land and all that working was outstanding, too, because we had done the approach and landing test where we dropped it off of the back of the carrier aircraft. We'd done those in California. But we'd never really done landing out of orbit before. Of course, these all had to be pinpoint landings. You wanted to be there at the landing strip. So that was pretty exciting and made me feel really proud to have it come back and land right where it was supposed to."

I probably feel like that's one of my really strong accomplishments, I guess for the administrative part of that.\\n\\n Technically, probably I would have to go back to my first apogee rendezvous with Pete [Charles] Conrad [Jr.] in Gemini. That was something that was only done once and it's not been done since then. It was very ambitious, had to work hand-in-glove with the flight crew. It was something that I enjoyed a great deal. So that was probably one of the real high technical points.\\n\\n Challenges. I think this would probably be the staffing of the Apollo missions, well, where the Gemini and the Apollo missions overlapped in trying to make sure that we had the right people assigned and trained and had enough people to staff those, because those missions were coming a month apart, the Geminis were coming a month apart, and then overlaid on that were the Apollo missions.

I don't know.\\n\\n I always enjoyed hobbies, and my main hobby was working on old cars, so I kind of immerse myself in that. Because at work, you know, we would work hard, but we worked with paper and pencils and computers. So when I'd get home, I'd enjoy getting out there and getting a little grease on me working on these old cars. I involved my son in that and my wife helped me some, too. So we had some family synergism with hobbies. We were able to have some good quality time, but it was just not as much as we're finding out we have now. But it doesn't hurt to struggle. There were times when, to make everything come together and put the time in at work was a little bit of a struggle. But looking back on it, you know, I think it was worthwhile."

Frankly, the whole space program unfolded almost from nothing during the period of time when I was working there. Looking back on it, I really feel so fortunate to have been in the right place, because there are talented people coming out of college right now, and the most exciting thing they're going to have to do is, if they sit down around the table with me and we talked about it, they would be disappointed, because we really had the cream of the crop as far as excitement and experiences and opportunities. I'm so grateful for that, that I did have that opportunity.\\n\\n You could almost see within a program sometimes how it was going to unfold, but then when the next program came along, it was so different, and it just captured your imagination and whisked you away. We in the group, my age group, that were in NASA were extremely fortunate to have the opportunity, because if one day they go back to the Moon, I think the people that are involved in that will love it. Of course, they'll have a lot of new things available to them, but that's the kind of thing that possibly will never happen again."

        "utterance": "Okay. Born February 19, 1932, in Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. I was accused by my big brothers and sisters—I’m the seventh child in the family—of having either caused or perpetuated the Depression by my birth, but I don’t think that’s true. I am a Depression baby, however. Although I was too young to serve in World War II, I had two older brothers who did serve in that war. I feel more and more out of it as I get older, because there are so many people now who don’t remember the events that were absolutely central to the lives of us who were growing up in high school and in grade school during that war.\\n\\n I read science fiction a lot when I was a kid. Of course, there was no such thing as the space program, and I’m talking the forties through the early fifties. The first V-2 rockets, I guess, appeared in the mid-forties, but there was no talk about sending people into space. It was all fantasy fiction. Again, my nasty big brothers used to say, “Oh, little Joey wants to go to the Moon. Look, he’s reading K. E. Van Volker, Robert [A.] Heinlein again.”\\n\\n I went to Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, as a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy, with a pre-med minor. Liked the pre-med minor, so I went on to medical school at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois]. We’re in the mid-fifties now. I graduated from Northwestern in 1957, so I was an intern at the District of Columbia General Hospital in Washington, D.C., when Sputnik went off. I had no feeling of connection to Sputnik or the space effort at that time. I was merely a civilian guy going through an internship.\\n\\n But there was an interesting thing in the fifties called the \"doctors draft,\" the Berry Plan, that was the way the military got their supply of physicians. They gave you exemptions from the draft as long as you were enrolled in a legitimate medical educational program, including internship and including residency, and as soon as you finished it, your name went in the hopper. If it got pulled out, you were up for a two years' service.\\n\\n My name went in the hopper during my internship and was pulled out by the Navy, so I got this letter about January of 1958, I guess, saying, “Hello there. You have been drafted and assigned to the Navy,\" blah, blah, blah. And I was in Washington, so I got in my car and went up to 14th and I, I think it is, to the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery and presented my letter, and said, “What duties have you got available?”\\n\\n One of the several duties that they offered to me was the last seat in the flight surgeon school that July, just after getting out of internship. “Cost you an extra six months,” it said, “but you learn how to be a flight surgeon and you get a little flying time while you’re at it, about twenty hours of time under instruction and just for the experience, and if you pass the physical and the check, you may get to solo in the T-34.” So I said, “Great.”\\n\\n I bought my uniforms and went down to Pensacola, went through the aviation medicine, and was assigned to the U.S. Marines at Cherry Point, North Carolina, 1959. We are at the beginning of the NASA program now, the height of the Cold War, a time when it was a very acceptable and patriotic thing to be in the military. I enjoyed my tour with the Marines just immensely, and they were very good to their Navy doctor. They allowed me to start and taxi their fighter aircraft around. [Laughter] A little bit unconventional, but the Marines were like that. They said, “Yes, let’s teach the doc how to taxi. Just don’t take off.” So I did that.\\n\\n The bug really bit me, and I applied for a program that the Navy had had for several years already, in which they trained a small number of flight surgeons to be naval aviators. This had gotten started back in the late thirties, when a number of Navy flight surgeons in aviation medicine was very new in the thirties, said, “We can understand this pilot business better if you’d train us to be pilots.” Half a dozen of them applied for that. Flight training was pretty inexpensive and it didn’t take too long in the thirties, so they trained these guys up to be pilots.\\n\\n Then World War II happened, and at the end of the war, the Navy noticed that those people had done a wonderful job through the war as flight surgeons and were in senior command positions in the Medical Corps. They said, “This is a good program. We’ll continue it.”\\n\\n About once a year or once every two years, they accept an application from a doc—and they’re still doing it—to be a pilot, get the full flight training, fly the high-performance aircraft and understand the environment better, so that they can apply that experience to certifying and treating pilots. So I applied for that and was accepted, and in 1961 entered flight training in the Navy and transferred from the naval reserve to the regular Navy in order to do that.\\n\\n I went through flight training. I was assigned to an air wing at Cecil Field, Florida, and met a couple of friends among my pilot patients, if you will, one of whom was Jim [James A.] Lovell and the other was Alan [L.] Bean. One at a time, both these guys came to me and said, “Joe, I’m going to apply to be an astronaut. Would you help me fill out my medical forms?” So I did, and they were both accepted, obviously.\\n\\n Suddenly now I had a connection, a personal connection, however tenuous, to what was going on in Houston. In 1964, I was sitting in front of the television with my wife, I think it was David Brinkley, the old Huntley-Brinkley show, announced, “NASA has announced that it will hire scientist-astronauts to go to the Moon.”\\n\\n My wife looked at me and said, “You’d like to do that, wouldn’t you?”\\n\\n I said, “I’m not a scientist. I’m just a doc.” But I thought about it, and applied through the Navy. Since there weren’t many physicians who could pass the physical and had 2,000 hours of time in single-engine jet aircraft, that turned out to be enough, and I was accepted into the astronaut program in 1965."

        "utterance": "Well, I thought it was wonderful, but, of course, the whole thing was so new that I had no idea what they were really going to do with us, and they didn’t either. But it turned out, in retrospect, that the determining factor there was the announcement of the Apollo Program, that they were going to land humans on the Moon, and that there were scientific programs to be carried out on the Moon. Immediately, the scientific community, represented, I think, by the National Academy of Sciences, strongly recommended to NASA that some of the people who go to the Moon and participate in these scientific missions should have genuine scientific backgrounds and not be test pilots.\\n\\n NASA thought about that for a while, thinking, “This is a highly technical, highly risky, test-piloting program. We’re not sure we can afford to carry scientists who aren’t pilots along,” but they finally agreed that they would hire some scientists, train them to be pilots, so that they could do the piloting jobs as well, at least in an assistant mode, and carried on like that. It was a hybrid, transitional sort of decision.\\n\\n I know that when we showed up at NASA in 1965, and I was a member of a group of six people, only two of whom were already trained pilots, the other four were not, and they were immediately sent off to the Air Force to get that \"second-class\" kind of pilot training that the Navy doesn’t give you.\\n\\n The two of us joined the astronaut program, but they didn’t start us into formal training, because two people doesn’t make a class. They decided to wait for the next pilot class to come along. So I went to my first Monday morning pilots' meeting in Building 4, up on the third floor in the conference room, and Deke [Donald K. Slayton] and Alan [B. Shepard, Jr.] were at the front of the room. The guys are sitting there, and I’m in the back, and they introduced me.\\n\\n Then Shepard says, “Headquarters has okayed the selection of another group of astronauts next year.”\\n\\n And Dick [Richard F.] Gordon [Jr.] said, “Are they going to be pilots?”\\n\\n Shepard said, “Well, I certainly hope so.” [Laughter] So I sort of realized that I was here, but I didn’t have a distinct role yet.\\n\\n As it turned out, one of the six resigned very shortly after coming into the program. The rest of the five of us were a mixed bag of specialties, and the only one who eventually went to the Moon on the Apollo Program was Jack [Harrison H.] Schmitt, which was perfectly appropriate because he was the geologist. As the physician in the group, it became pretty clear to me, of course, I would raise my hand whenever there was a new crew to be assigned, and they’d say, “Sit down, Kerwin,\" but it was very clear that something to do with medical research on long-duration space flight was probably where I was going to fit. It wasn’t until the Skylab Program, even before it was called that, began to come in in 1966 and ’67, that I felt like I had a role and a mission to shoot for."

I think Owen [K.] Garriott and Ed [Edward G.] Gibson were pretty well accepted, even though they were physicists and engineers, whereas [F.] Curt Michel, who was a paper-and-pencil astronomer was not so well accepted, but I think that was the degree to which we merged and subordinated our scientific interests to those of the program.\\n\\n For example, I remember going to Captain Shepard very early in my time there, when I didn’t have a lot to do, was waiting around for the next class to show up so we could train. I said, “Captain Shepard (I didn’t call him Al at that time), do you think I should keep my hand in medicine by going to the clinic a day or two a week?” He looked at me with his steely eyes and said he didn’t think that would be a very good idea, that I had plenty of other stuff to do. [Laughter] And you sort of get your priorities in order that way, and realize that clinical medicine is not going to be your job in this program, that keeping on top of medical research and medical issues in space flight was very important, and he encouraged me to do that, but they also encouraged me to train as an astronaut. I was going to sit in that cockpit, and they had to be able to rely on me.\\n\\n It turned out that medicine, since there were so many medical issues involved in flying into space, was a very easy profession to reconcile with the duties of an astronaut. All of the astronauts, in addition to just training, had technical jobs that they had to do. One of them would concentrate on boosters. One of them would concentrate on space suits, one on orbital navigation—Buzz [Edwin E.] Aldrin [Jr.] comes to mind—life support systems, so on and so forth. It’s easy if you’re a doc to find that the life support systems and the space suits and the cabin atmosphere and a lot of other things are things your background helps you to understand. So I had the medical background. I had to pick up the engineering informally, enough to understand what the trades were.\\n\\n It was easy to work as an astronaut with a medical background. I think that’s still true today. I think that’s why we see a fair number of docs picked up as mission specialists. It’s a little harder for an astronomer to use his or her background in the program, and I think that’s why people like Dr. Michel didn’t make it as well, is that reconciliation job was hard to do."

My very first one was environmental control systems, just picking up on what the atmosphere problems, and why we were using 100 percent oxygen, and looking at some of the long-duration tests that were going on even in the early sixties, in the mid-sixties. Out at Douglas [Aircraft Company] they had a ninety-day study where they shut people up in a can.\\n\\n My mentor in that area was Bill [William A.] Anders, since has had a wonderful career as CEO of a big aerospace company. Bill was a very organized guy. He said, “You’ve got to reduce these things to their simplest terms, keep notes on three-by-five file cards, and organize your thinking, and you’ll be fine.\" Okay. So I picked that duty up from him for a while when he went off to train for his Gemini backup mission, which he complained—I think he was assigned to backup crew either Gemini XI or Gemini XII, and he said, “Kerwin, it’s like learning every nut and bolt in the Santa Maria. It’s useless knowledge. We’re going to the Moon, and I’m stuck with this Gemini backup role.” So I did that under his tutelage.\\n\\n Then Ken [Thomas K.] Mattingly got a backup assignment in Apollo, and they turned over the space suit technical assignment to me, and that was just wonderful. I got to try on the new suits. There are a number of suits still hanging on the racks over there that have Kerwin’s name and were fitted to me, just because that was my assignment, was to check those things out. I remember participating in the Source Evaluation Board for the Apollo suits and reading the proposals and seeing the prototypes from Hamilton Standard and their research, and the outfit in Massachusetts."

It was strong enough, it was resilient enough, had all the properties of that kind that made it safe to use as a helmet on the Moon, but it was soft and scratchable, and its optical properties were not good.\\n\\n They went through hell, the engineers did, trying to blow those bubble helmets in a controlled way that made them suitable to look through, free from distortions and spots and all of that. They finally managed. It was a company called Airlock, Incorporated, again in the New England area, that finally figured out how to blow those helmets. We went through quite a selection process. They probably had to blow ten of them for every two or three that we approved. So it was great fun working the suits.\\n\\n At about that time—I’m changing the subject, is that all right?"

        "utterance": "I was asked by Al one day—in fact, Curt Michel and I were asked to get a T-38 and go out to the Douglas plant and have a look at an S-IVB stage that was in production out there, because the Marshall Space Flight Center [Huntsville, Alabama] had this crazy idea they wanted to use the inside of an S-IVB fuel tank as a space station prototype or a laboratory or something. So Al said, “Get out there and have a look, and come back and tell us what you think.”\\n\\n So Curt and I went out there. We were pleasantly received and taken to the production line where this big old S-IVB, third stage of the Saturn V, and second stage of the S-IB with the first, I guess, restartable engine in the line, was coming through. They said, “Well, this is it.” On the end of it, the dome had a big hatch with seventy-two bolts in it. We said, “How’s the crew going to get in there?”\\n\\n He said, “Well, we’ll give you a wrench, and you can undo the seventy-two bolts.”\\n\\n “Oh, okay.” We went on in, in our stocking feet and our white coats and all, because this was a flight stage. [Sniffs] And there's this chemical smell from the material they used to cure the sides. It was a fiberglass lay-up with some kind of protective coating over it, and it smelled funny. “How are we going to get rid of that smell?” we said.\\n\\n “Oh, it will leach out given time.”\\n\\n There was nothing else in there except some helium spheres to pressurize the tank, a propellant utilization probe, essentially a fuel gauge, running down the middle of it and wired to the side. Lots of sharp edges. And that was it. We said, “What are we going to do in here?”\\n\\n “Well, we haven’t figured that out yet. Maybe you could put on your suits and sort of fly around and check out the EVAs [extravehicular activity] in here. It’s a nice big area.”\\n\\n “Are you going to pressurize it?”\\n\\n “Well, we haven’t decided, but we think we probably ought to pressurize it with oxygen.” Okay. Very, very primitive stage of the whole thing.\\n\\n So we went back. I wrote a memo to Al saying that they had a long way to go. Curt wrote another one saying he didn’t see any evidence of any scientific value in this whole operation, which, from his point of view, was certainly true. But the Marshall people were serious, and they very rapidly converged on a configuration whereby this thing could be utilized for at least long-duration habitability experiments, and possibly for much more.\\n\\n It was a very rapidly developing program, Skylab. In fact, it wasn’t much more than a year later, maybe a year and a half after that, mid- to late 1967, when I found myself in Huntsville one evening with a handful of other astronauts, led at that time by Al Bean. He was the senior guy in this group. We were outlining in chalk on the floor of the mockup building at Huntsville the layout for the crew quarters of the Apollo Applications Program, which was going to be Skylab. “Now, we’ve put the sleep compartments over here, now they’re too big. Make them smaller. Here’s where the waste-management thing has to go,\" blah, blah. It was fun. We felt like we were in on the ground floor of a program.\\n\\n At that time, Skylab was a wet workshop, because it didn’t have a Saturn V booster assigned to it. The Skylab was to be launched as the second stage of the S-IB, which meant it had to be a working stage. So, filled with liquid hydrogen in an engine on the back, burnt into orbit, then you open vents, let the hydrogen leach out for a couple days, close the vents, backfill with oxygen to a third of an atmosphere, and then undo the seventy-two bolts, through an adapter section, of course, and let the crew come on in and do their thing. The program manager was going nuts trying to figure out how much outfitting he could do in a stage that was going to be used and filled with liquid hydrogen. They couldn’t find any wiring, for example, that would withstand the temperatures. It was proving to be a very difficult thing.\\n\\n It was a big breakthrough for the program when they were finally assigned a Saturn V, I think at the expense of Apollo 18, 19, and 20. When those three flights were removed from the Apollo Program manifest, three Saturn Vs came available. To the best of my knowledge, we used the one to launch the workshop and the other two are sitting out here as displays at JSC and Huntsville. That was a big day when we went from the wet workshop to the dry workshop. Instantly we had what space programs up to that time had never had: weight margin and volume. We had all the weight and the volume in the world. They didn’t have to cut corners. We could load all the consumables for three flights on. We could put experiments of all kinds up there, medical, solar physics, Earth resources, without worrying too much about the weight margins. So it became an easy program."

        "utterance": "You know, I don’t remember exactly when that dry workshop date happened. It was either ’68 or ’69, somewhere in there. Of course, we were all weaving in and out of the program as a technical assignment and going to other assignments.\\n\\n I had a fun assignment in there as a member of the crew of two hangar queens. The first one was called Spacecraft 008. It was the altitude chamber test command module for the Block I Program. It was to precede Apollo 1, the flight that [Virgil I. “Gus”] Grissom, [Edward H.] White [II] and [Roger B.] Chaffee were to have. We had three astronauts assigned to spend a week in Chamber A in Building 32, which was brand new at that time, testing that spacecraft out, and we did. Had a good time doing it. We utilized equipment and a procedure which was the same equipment and the same procedure that killed the crew of Apollo 1, so we considered ourselves, in retrospect, very fortunate that we didn’t have a spark.\\n\\n So after that, back into Skylab for a while, and then out again to command my first mission, which was the second hangar queen, which was called the 2-TV1, Block II, Test Vehicle 1, spacecraft Number 98, the first Apollo Block II post-fire spacecraft off the assembly line. Vance [D.] Brand and Joe [H.] Engle were my crewmates, so we had a good crew. We went out to California, out to the Rockwell plant for two or three weeks, to bring the thing through the test program out there at the plant, before delivery to the Manned Spacecraft Center. I nearly said JSC; it wasn’t yet. And then it went into the chamber and we went into it. We spent another week there, testing out the new launch procedures that avoided the use of 100 percent oxygen. Of course, we had all the new fireproof materials, insulation equipment, and so on, in the vehicle. So we felt like we were breaking some ground and doing some necessary testing to enable the Wally [Walter M.] Shirra [Jr.] flight of Apollo 7. So that was good. And then back into Skylab again.\\n\\n As I recall, it was early 1970. It was, because [Charles C.] Pete Conrad had just come off his Apollo 12 flight, which was November ’69, so this had to be around January or February of 1970 when Slayton came into a pilot’s meeting on a Monday morning, he had a sheet of paper in his hand, he said, “The following people are now formally assigned to crew training and mission development for the Skylab program.” He read the names of fifteen people. “Conrad, Kerwin, [Paul J.] Weitz, [R. Walter] Cunningham, Brand.” God, I forget the exact routine now. He didn’t say who was prime, who was backup, who was what mission or anything else. All he said was that Conrad was going to be Sky King. He was in charge, and he would tell us all what he wanted us to do.\\n\\n We had no idea what that list meant. There was a lot of speculation going on about who was going to be on what mission. There were fifteen of us, which meant there were three prime crews but only two backup crews, so somebody was going to have double duty as a backup crew, it looked like, unless the first prime was going to be the last backup. Deke didn’t say. Deke was not a man of many words. He didn’t say more than he thought was necessary at the time.\\n\\n It turned out, again in retrospect, that the way he had read that list was first prime, first backup, second prime, second backup, third prime, just in order. But it took a couple of years before the specific crew assignments were made, probably in ’72 that we actually knew for sure that we were going to go with Pete on the first flight."

        "utterance": "Once again, I was, for no particular reason that I could figure out, assigned as the lead CAPCOM on that job. What that meant was that you got to do the schedule. So my other guys were Vance Brand and Jack [R.] Lousma, were the other two CAPCOMs on Apollo 13.\\n\\n We split up the duty differently than the different teams of flight controllers, because we had training responsibilities to consider and we wanted to specialize in different areas. I did not know much about lunar modules, but I knew a lot about suits and I was a good command module person, having spent these two seven-day periods running command modules. I was also the boss, so I did the launch, the lunar surface EVA, and reentry, were my key things. I seems to me that Vance Brand did translunar injection, TLI, and had those key command module burns, and I think Jack had the lunar module descent activities and specialized in the LM [lunar module]. I’ll go back and look at this now, and I could be wrong in my memory, because, of course, it all came unraveled after the mission started. But we trained in our different areas, and assigned ourselves to different teams during the mission and participated in all the sims [simulations] and did our thing.\\n\\n The launch was pretty uneventful. The center engine on the second stage shut down prematurely. I remember that very clearly because I saw that light come on and just turned and looked at the booster guy, Frank [L.] Van Rensselaer, to see how long it would be before he would tell us something to tell the crew. He told us to tell the crew that it was a go, just about the time the crew called down and said, “We’ve had a center engine out, Houston. Over.” So that worked out fine. Everything else appeared to be nominal.\\n\\n I remember going home and having dinner and going to bed early, because I had the 6 o’clock a.m. duty the next morning as CAPCOM. I was walking into the bedroom from the television, when in the background I heard something about \"They seem to have a problem on Apollo 13.\" I went on to bed. Got a call about midnight from Vance, who was on console. He said, “Joe, the lunar mission is over.” He meant the lunar landing. “We’ve had some kind of explosion in the service module. We’re still trying to figure it out. It’s a bad situation. I wanted you to know about it before you came over for your shift.” Well, of course, that was the end of sleep for me.\\n\\n Like everybody else, I was over there early, standing behind Vance and just trying to soak up what was going on as we defaulted to a different schedule and made ourselves up a different watch schedule pretty much now connected to the different teams that were working. And again, since I was the reentry CAPCOM, I retained that designation, and Vance and Jack did their things, making sure they were on the console for the main—\\n\\n Lousma became a very important CAPCOM there because he was the best, the most experienced in lunar module operations, and he knew lunar module systems the best. So we struggled through. I became part of the team that was making up the protocol and the checklist for waking up the command module about three hours prior to reaching entry interface.\\n\\n The real work there was being done by the backup crew, especially by Ken Mattingly, over in the simulator. To cycle back to a few days before the flight, you will already have heard the German Measles episode. I was shocked by the decision that they made on that. The doctor. I said, “German Measles is a mild illness in adults. A little fever, a little malaise, and then it’s over with. You think that will slow Mattingly down, even if he gets it? No way. And it’s very important that this crew which has trained together on this mission stay together.” I happened to express that opinion in a meeting at which Dr. [Christopher C.] Kraft [Jr.], the center director, was present. The way I phrased it was, “I don’t agree with Dr. [Charles A.] Berry’s decision.” Kraft turned his beady eyes on me and said, “I just want to know, Dr. Kerwin, that that wasn’t Dr. Berry’s decision. That was my blankety-blank decision.” [Laughter] I was put in my place.\\n\\n Of course, it worked out great. If you believe in fate, you have to look and say that there was nobody better suited than Ken Mattingly on the ground to go into the simulator and figure out how to save the mission, and, in particular, how to turn the command module off completely and then power it up in a careful, regulated way that minimized the use of power, but had the systems up in time to get ready for entry interface. Very difficult job, and he was just wonderful at it. His experience and his workaholic nature both assured that he had the detailed knowledge and he knew how to use it, go in and take over. So it was really nice. There was, I think, some opinion around that maybe Ken should be the entry CAPCOM, and Ken wouldn’t have any of it. He said, “I’ll sit here with Joe, and together we’ll make sure that things happen.”\\n\\n So my memory of Apollo 13, a couple of them. One is just long hours of sitting there at the CAPCOM console with my headset on and white noise in the headset, and listening and listening and listening for the crew to call through the white noise. What they had done, they would power down the high gain antenna on the spacecraft to save power, and so you didn’t get a good voice connection, but just good enough to hear them. If they called, then you’d command the high gain antenna on and get better com and go ahead and do your thing. So I spent hours just listening in case the crew had a problem during off times.\\n\\n Then I remember at the very end—let’s see what the sequence was. They transferred to the command module. They did the command module activation. It worked perfectly. They jettisoned the service module. Saw the terrible damage and had time to snap a couple of pictures, and now it’s Jack [John L.] Swigert’s big moment. He has to align the platform on the command module before jettisoning the lunar module. He did that by looking through the telescope, finding two stars, and marking on the stars so that the star angle difference could be measured precisely, thereby verifying that these two stars were the ones he thought they were. Those two locations would tell the platform what its attitude was. Very, very critical to an accurate reentry.\\n\\n He’s having a terrible time doing it because the lunar module is sitting on the front of the command module and reflecting light into the telescope, obscuring the star background. He’s having trouble identifying the stars, for that reason. He tried, didn’t work. Try it again, didn’t work. We are racketing [phonetic] toward the atmosphere at 36,000 miles an hour and I’m sweating bullets, and I’m looking up at [Eugene F.] Kranz, who was standing right over here, and Kranz is going [demonstrates]. In other words, “Give them another few minutes. Give them another few minutes. We’ve got another few minutes.” And finally from the spacecraft comes, “Five balls.” Meaning the star angle difference is 0.0000. He has correctly identified the stars. The platform is aligned. From there on out, it was just routine, or seemed like it. That was, to me, the most dramatic moment as a CAPCOM."

I think they were both handled pretty well, but Al’s in particular, a significant period of time went by, the symptoms had subsided, there was no residual damage to the vestibular system, and he was certified for flight in a relatively routine fashion.\\n\\n Deke’s problem was more difficult because it was arrhythmia, and those things do tend to recur, and if they recur, they’re usually not harmful. You could have made the argument back in 1962, I guess it was, and some of the doctors did make the argument, that this atrial fibrillation was intermittent, would not have interfered in a short mission, and it was just that overwhelming conservatism that said, “We know it probably doesn’t matter, but if you can find another crew member who hadn’t got that problem, it’s just one less thing to worry about.” It’s too bad, because Deke was a splendid crew member and a good leader and would have been a good commander on an Apollo mission. It was not to be. I think he quit smoking at some point early on in there, and had had a stretch now of several years without fibrillation recurring, and that’s what made them feel that they were safe in sending him up. And they were right, he didn’t have a problem in flight."

        "utterance": "We figured out after that we might have trained more than any space flight crew up to that time, and that was due to a couple of factors. One was the large number of different science disciplines that was on this mission as compared to the Apollo missions. And two, was simply the long preparation time.\\n\\n —Skylab in 1966, so I worked it for seven years on and off, partly training, partly participating in decisions as to the configuration of the spacecraft and the experiment package. So we helped to design the experiments as well as just training for it. I don’t want to give you the impression that I participated in the design of the ATM [Apollo Telescope Mount] experiments, the solar physics stuff. I wasn’t smart enough to do that. I think Owen [Garriott] and Ed [Gibson] did to some extent, in the joint observing program world. I concentrated on the medical experiments, and we had a lot to say about some of them, and it wasn’t all favorable, either.\\n\\n Example. The M-131 vestibular function experiment, designed by a genius, also a really sweet man, Dr. Ashton Graybiel of the U.S. Navy Medical Research Institute in Pensacola, had done an enormous amount of research on vestibular adaptation to unusual environments, and he designed this experiment which had several different modules in it. And the module we all hated was the motion sickness susceptibility test. He had devised this wonderful test where you sit in the chair, and the chair rotates at a rate that’s been determined with pre-flight testing. While it’s rotating, you move your head forward and sideways and back, in and out of the plane of rotation in such a way that it’s very provocative. He tried to titrate the rotation rate so that it was somewhere around fifty head movements before you barfed, or maybe seventy-five. He wanted to bring us right up to the point of barfing but not quite, as his endpoint, and then to compare susceptibility in flight to susceptibility on the ground.\\n\\n The reason for all this was we’d had a number of documented or suspected cases of space motion sickness, a motion sickness a lot like seasickness, but occurring in the first twenty-four hours of space flight. So we knew that he was up to something legitimate, but it wasn’t very pleasant. So the first thing we did was to get him to back off from what he called malaise three to malaise two, so that we could quit reliably before we threw up. He agreed readily, and we tested that a little bit, and we backed off and did that.\\n\\n The second thing we insisted on was that since there was always a chance that you’d go too far, and you’d get somebody throwing up and motion sick and really miserable up there, that you’d exempt the commander, Pete Conrad on our flight, from that part of Graybiel’s test, so that we’d always have one guy who was in good shape to take us home if we started losing pressure or had an emergency. And he agreed to that. Graybiel was nothing if not easy to get along with. He was a peach. So we in that sense helped to re-jigger the experiment to make it what we thought was more operationally compatible.\\n\\n They got all their data, and to our amazement, in flight, by the time we had gone through all of our adventures on the first few days of the mission and gotten to the point of doing Ash’s experiment, we found that you couldn’t make yourself motion sick. Once you had adapted, you were bullet-proof. We eventually, all three of us, spun the chair up to the maximum rotation it was capable of which was 30 rpm, just about like a long-playing record, and make the maximum number of head movements you were allowed to make, which was 150. You know, your neck would be pretty tired. No malaise, no sweating, none of those pre-vomiting symptoms at all. A little nystagmus, that was it. We had discovered a new phenomenon, or Ash had discovered it with us as subjects. We felt, in retrospect, a little sheepish about our great conservatism and our fear of this experiment, which was totally unjustified by events. But anyway, there it was.\\n\\n The other one that we argued a lot about was the metabolic balance experiment. We just knew this one was going to make our life miserable. It was an experiment to measure complete intake and output of everything we ate, everything we drank, everything we urinated, everything we defecated, and they wanted to do everything we perspired, but he couldn’t figure out how to collect the sweat properly, so they had to skip that one. He wanted every molecule of sodium in and out. This was Dr. Don Whedon. He was doing a very meticulous job. He had done intake and output experiments in medical labs, and he knew how to do it, but the thing he wanted to do was to put us all on the same standard diet, pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. Everybody gets 2,400 calories; everybody gets 800 milligrams of calcium, right on down the line, protein, carbohydrate, everything, exactly measured.\\n\\n We said, “This isn’t going to work.” We had Jack Lousma, who was a great big 6'1\" or 2\" Marine, who routinely eats 3,200 or 3,500 calories a day, and is trim and fit. And we had Al Bean on the other extreme, who’s about a 1,900 calorie-a-day person, and he’s trim and fit. You’re not going to feed them both 2,400 calories a day for what amounts to three months and get away with it. In fact, Whedon was convinced this was the standard way to do intake and output, and damn it, that’s the way he was going to do it.\\n\\n We were rescued by a crew called the SMEAT crew. I don’t know if anybody’s brought that acronym up to you before, SMEAT, S-M-E-A-T, Skylab Medical Experiments Altitude Test. This was a test run in one of the altitude chambers in Building 7, with a crew of three astronauts, for fifty-six days, which was the longest duration then contemplated for a Skylab mission, using the medical experiment hardware and the same diet as was planned for the mission. It had Bo [Karol J.] Bobko, Bob [Robert L.] Crippen, and, bless his heart, Bill [William E.] Thornton. Bill Thornton was built like and exercised a lot like Jack Lousma, and he was in there on 2,400 calories a day. He was losing weight like mad, and was very seriously irritated about all this. He said, “The only thing that kept me from killing that guy was the two inches of steel between us.” [Laughter]\\n\\n As a result of that fiasco, the scales fell from everybody’s eyes, and we got Deke Slayton behind us and the program manager, and said, “You’ve got to feed these people what they need. Feed them what they need, and they’ll go along with the regimen and the careful measurement of input and output and all that stuff.” And we would. We just wanted enough to eat. So we changed the routine, and we went through a one-week period of eating all our meals at the laboratory in one of the buildings around the center, being fed carefully measured portions, and if we didn’t eat it all, they took it back and measured it. They got to know what everybody’s dietary intake was, and tailored our meals to that dietary intake.\\n\\n That wasn’t quite the end of it, because there was another hypothesis floating around. It was a theory, everybody knew it was true, that when you went weightless, since the large muscles of the body were not being used, it was a lot like being at bed rest. And if you’re at bed rest, your basal metabolic rate goes down, your resting heart rate goes down, your caloric expenditure goes down, and you don’t eat as much. So we even took our average daily caloric intake from the little seven-day test and subtracted 300 calories from it, then tailored everything from that. So instead of getting what we were getting, what we ate normally on the ground, we got what he thought we would normally eat in space based on this theory, which turned out to be totally false. [Laughter] And it wasn’t his fault. I believed the theory, too. I thought, “Yes, that’s probably about right.” Turned out not to be true.\\n\\n He started us on this diet three weeks before the flight, to get a three-week baseline period. This is good science. And for eighteen days after the flight. That’s actually three six-day periods. We had a six-day diet cycle. I don’t remember why. Of course, that diet was identical to the in-flight diet. The food even came from the same lots. So the result there was that pre-flight and post-flight, we were 300 calories down from our normal diet. He wouldn’t give us anything extra to eat except lemon drops. Empty calories. \"You can have some empty calories, but I don’t want you taking any minerals, I don’t want you taking any protein. All that has to be steady.\"\\n\\n You can imagine we had some arguments with Don and, to a lesser extent, on some of the other experiments in all the habitability stuff. The crew was very active in this whole experiment called long-duration flying in space. What should the bathroom be like? How about the restraints and mobility aids, the kind of foot restraints? All of that stuff. We were co-experimenters, if you will, in all that. Sometimes maybe we overdid our conservatism a little, but we got a darn good spacecraft out of it.\\n\\n I remember about three weeks before launch, Chris Kraft calling us up to his office. He tells this story differently than I remember it, but that’s typical. My recollection of it is that Chris sat us down and said basically, “Now, listen guys. You’ve had a lot of disagreements with the medical investigators over this whole training period. It’s time to put that all behind you now and go do the stuff.”\\n\\n Pete said, “Chris, we already decided to do that. We’re happy with what we’ve got. We’re going to give it our best shot,\" which we went and did.\\n\\n Chris remembers the same conversation of being more of a lecture than it really was. “You guys, you've got to knock it off now.”\\n\\n So it was that interesting relationship. We weren’t just guinea pigs; we were also co-investigators, informally, on all the experimental work that went on. Had a wonderful time doing it."

That meant, by the nature of things, that I spent very little time on the Earth observations experiments. I had one particular camera, the S-190 five-inch camera that I was responsible for, but that was pretty simple stuff. All of the time-lining and major decisions were made by Pete and Paul on that.\\n\\n We all did a lot of training on ATM. I did more than them because I had the malfunction procedures to learn in the computer. We spent—I’ve got the training hours around somewhere on a piece of paper, but thousands of hours of total training time, counting everything. It was good. In the command module, obviously Pete was the commander and he did the flying. I was the navigator and did the telescope and sextant stuff and the computer stuff. Paul was the systems expert for the electrical power system, the life support system, and all of the systems hardware and systems malfunctions. And we’ll all backed each other up, kind of in that order. So we all had all of that training to do. In the Skylab, again, Paul was the systems expert. I was ATM and medical, and Pete was earth resources and overall command.\\n\\n Pete was—I need to put in this plug for my late commander. I could not have had a finer commander to work with. He was moderately demanding, but very open. He wanted you to tell him when he screwed up, and he would tell you when he screwed up. He had this wonderful communication relationship with the mission control team, as well. There were no secrets, so there never was any tension built up. We did a little drinking together, we played baseball together from time to time. We simulated a lot, and he gave you responsibility and said, “Tell me what you’re doing and go do it.” So it was a real treat flying a mission which otherwise might have had its tense moments, with a crew that got along so well and was so well led."

        "utterance": "An amazing thing. I thought he’d outlive me. He had a lot of energy and was in excellent physical health and so on and so forth. I was just amazed to find that I can’t call him on the phone anymore. It’s too bad. But we did good.\\n\\n I’ve told this story often, I might as well tell it on tape. Pete told us this story several times during training and during the flight, about his initial run through the selection process with the Mercury 7 astronauts. He was one of the finalists. They went out to the Lovelace Clinic at Albuquerque, New Mexico, for their final physical examinations. Pete had a run-in with at least one of the docs. I believe it was the surgeon who did the procto-sigmoidoscopy, and Pete felt that he’d been unnecessarily rough and told him so. They got into a bit of a discussion on this at the bar that evening, okay. [Laughter] In the event Pete was rejected, and the basis for his rejection was a psychiatric evaluation that he was psychiatrically unsuited for long-duration space missions. So here's Conrad, he’s gone to the Moon, he’s up here in Skylab with us on the first-ever long-duration Space Station mission, and he's saying, “I’ll show that son of a gun. Who's psychologically unsuited for what?\" [Laughter]\\n\\n So he was very motivated to do a great job on Skylab. Just the kind of commander you want. He exercised more than we did, and kept us all up to a very high level. Even coming home. He said, “Guys, we’re going to walk out of this spacecraft. There’s going to be none of this carrying us out on stretchers stuff. There’s no time to do it like right away. When that hatch opens, I’m outta here, and I want you guys to follow me.” He had it all planned out.\\n\\n It could have been different, if we’d had a different kind of character, because we had some initial problems. We had a problem with the exercise bike, and this was a key piece of equipment not only to measure our aerobic fitness and our muscular strength, but to keep us fit. It was used about every fourth day in the full experiment mode, where we carefully went through a graduated exercise cycle, fully instrumented and measuring oxygen consumption and CO2 production and a very careful appraisal, but we found, when we first tried to ride the bike, that we couldn’t ride it to the high levels.\\n\\n On the ground, knowing that we were going to be weightless, and nobody had ever ridden a bike in weightlessness before, Story Musgrave helped us design a very elaborate harness to wear. It had a harness that strapped around here, and it had shoulder straps with separate adjustments, and it had four bungies that went to the ground, and really kept you in one position. It was okay on the ground. You were sitting on the seat anyway. You got up there and found that you don’t sit on a bicycle seat in weightlessness. The bicycle seat might as well not be there at all. It’s a useless piece of hardware. And when you start to peddle, you ride up into this harness, and it’s so tight that it cuts off the circulation in your thighs, and your leg muscles get oxygen-starved. They start to hurt, and you just have to quit before you have reached the aerobic levels that are your goal.\\n\\n Pete was trying really, really hard to reach that peak level in spite of the pain and discomfort, and he started throwing premature ventricular contractions. He would throw an occasional odd PVC in his electrocardiogram. That’s not that disturbing a thing by itself, but here we are in space, and the docs were all very worried about the twenty-eight day duration. I’ll go back. Remind me to tell you about the monkey that preceded all that. So the harder we tried, the more concerned the guys on the ground got.\\n\\n It was probably about the eighth day in the mission when two things happened simultaneously. One, mission control and the doctors decided to restrain our exercise and say, “From now on, you can’t use the bicycle to exercise unless you are fully instrumented and over a state-side pass so we can watch your heart rate and your rhythm.” They were just getting ready to radio that up, when we were getting ready to radio them down that we had solved the exercise problem. We now knew how to ride the bike and we could get to our max levels without any problem.\\n\\n What we had done was to take Story Musgrave’s harness, carefully fold it up and shove it in the trash airlock. [Laughter] Instead, we put a couple towels on the overhead, so our head wouldn’t bump it too hard, and just found a posture with no restraint that eliminated the circulation problem, and we were off. So this resulted in Conrad and Chris Kraft having a private conference, and ironing out the issue. Pete said, “Call off the doctors. We have solved the problem. This is ridiculous.”\\n\\n And Chris said, “Okay. Whatever you say.”\\n\\n So off we went, but there was a little potential crisis there if they had backed us off from exercising. They were already concerned about all the hardware problems that Skylab was having at that time. We might have come down in worse shape than we did, and it might have hampered the follow-on crews. They might have cut them back to twenty-eight days, God knows. But Pete was a good leader and led us through that problem and into the sunshine of successful performance.\\n\\n I will go back and tell you about the monkey. It’s 1969, and the Skylab Program has gotten the dry workshop, and we’re well in the preparation process, the crews haven’t been selected yet, when NASA launches an unmanned but monkeyed satellite called Bio Satellite. The purpose was to serve as sort of pathfinder for Skylab by flying a monkey for thirty days, and bringing it back and measuring what its physiological changes and decrements were. This was part of that not-too-popular-with-astronauts 1960s' mind-set that if a monkey can do it, then it’s okay for you.\\n\\n So off they went with the monkey. About day five of the mission, the monkey stopped doing the little game that gave it banana pellets. They still could give it a banana pellet that was eating. About day six, it stopped drinking, and its body temperature started to come down, and it became lethargic, and the heart rate decreased. They said, “What is going on up there?” They brought it down—I think I’m right—about day eight they de-orbited the thing and landed it and parachuted it in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii, and they successfully picked it up and they brought it to the Trippler Army Hospital, and it died some twelve hours after splashdown and had lost 25 percent of its body weight. Its heart rate was down to sixty, which for a monkey was terrible, and was in really bad shape.\\n\\n So the response of the wonderful scientists on the Bio Satellite Program was to march to Washington and give congressional testimony before a subcommittee saying that they had to call off the Skylab Program, because we were going to kill an astronaut with this absurd plan to fly for thirty days, until they had thoroughly wrung it out with the monkeys and found out what to do.\\n\\n We were sitting back there in Houston saying, “Now look. They put this monkey up there. It was in a cold spacecraft. It was restrained in such a way that it could only move its hands and feet. It was given an inadequate amount of food and water.\" Just like Dr. Weedan was planning to do with us, right, except he wouldn’t restrict the water. They restricted water. They had a measured amount of water. They thought they knew what was good for this guy, but he was in a cold, dry spacecraft and was probably urinating more than normal, as you do when you go into weightlessness.\\n\\n For one reason or another, it was the constraints on the monkey’s ability to cope with the environment, added to the fact that this particular monkey is a very fragile subject in experiments of that kind. They had a handful of monkeys, from memory about five, on the ground as baseline monkeys. They had picked the one to fly from this group of half a dozen baseline monkeys, and two of them died during the mission from random causes. You know, this is a fragile system. So we were only slightly worried by this.\\n\\n Dr. Berry, God bless him, Dr. Berry and I have had our run-ins over the years, but he stood up there and told the Congress and anybody else who cared to listen that the conditions were not comparable, and he had no qualms about sending guys up for twenty-eight days on Skylab. So off we went.\\n\\n But all this was in the background, plus the fact that the Russians had had a Salyut mission up for something like twenty-two or twenty-three days a year or so before we flew, establishing the then-record, and had lost that crew during reentry. It was later discovered that it was a hatch problem, and that they’d asphyxiated. The climate at mission control was one of tension. What is this about long-duration space flight that we haven’t managed it yet? They were very solicitous over the exercise problem, which turned out to be a mere blip, just a matter of learning how to do something in weightlessness."

        "utterance": "We were working our way through these problems for the first time. We thought it was ridiculous that we couldn’t have unmonitored private conversations with our family, but we couldn’t. The press was dead set against that, they wanted all that. “This is a public mission. It’s been paid for with government funds. We want to know every intimate detail, what goes on. What if they tell their wife that there’s a real serious problem on the spacecraft, but they won’t tell it on the normal air-to-ground to mission control? Why, the whole program could fail.” You know, the standard kind of argument that the press uses when they want to stick their noses in. The counterargument being, “Well, if you make it all public, then they won’t tell anybody. How will you be worse off?”\\n\\n So our crew decided before the flight that if we couldn’t have a private family conference, we wouldn’t have any family conferences, and that our wives were all Navy wives, and they were used to their husbands going off on cruises and not being around for periods of time, and they could tough it out and so could we. So we didn’t have any. I believe the subsequent crews softened that approach. They were going to be up there longer, and most of them weren’t Navy guys anyhow. [Laughter]\\n\\n So it was during the missions that compromise was finally worked out, where they would have their private conversations, these conversations would be listened into by one person who would make sure that nothing catastrophic to the welfare of the United States of America had been said, but would not reveal the actual transcript of these conferences to the public. That suited everybody, and that’s how we did it.\\n\\n We also had scheduled private medical conferences with our flight surgeon, and again, the flight surgeon was required, he was obligated, to tell any material that could affect the safe conduct of the flight to the flight director. And that was okay with us. It’s just that we wanted an opportunity to informally discuss things with Chuck Ross without having them get blown out of proportion and made into a big deal when they weren’t. You trust your flight surgeon, and you know he understands what you’re talking about, so we had some nice conversations with Chuck during the flight.\\n\\n And on top of that, the crew commander did have the authority to call a private conference with either the flight director or the center director if he wanted to. Pete did that once, on the exercise issue, to my recollection."

        "utterance": "I know that there were some friction in the relationship between Marshall and the Manned Spacecraft Center, but we really never saw any of that at our level. Pete may have seen some of it, but I sure didn’t. I remember the Marshall guys coming down to brief the Manned Spacecraft Center guys in 1966 on their plans, and the guys from Houston saying essentially, “That sounds nice, but can’t we put it off for a while? We’re trying to go to the Moon here.” And the Marshall guy saying, “This is going to go with you or without you.” I know there was this competition, and I’ve read about it since, for more authority and more to do with human space flight. [Wernher] Von Braun had a feeling that he could do that, too.\\n\\n Skylab is probably as deep in human space flight as the folks at Huntsville got, but thanks to strong Headquarters leadership and essentially good will on both sides, the strong leaders, [Robert R.] Gilruth at JSC and von Braun at Marshall, and the guys running the program at Headquarters, Bill [William C.] Schneider was the program manager, great guy, they worked out an acceptable set of responsibilities and authorities, and we carried them out without any difficulty.\\n\\n We spent a lot of time in Huntsville. For one thing, aside from the developmental work, we did all our EVA training in the big water tank down at Huntsville. We spent some time in between the launch of Skylab and our launch down at Huntsville, trying out the Marshall sail solution to the loss of the heat shield. They ran a good ship down there. They always welcomed us. We stayed at a particular motel which was seven dollars with black and white television and eight bucks with color. [Laughter] This was the good old days, right?\\n\\n We were very used to the T-38 directorate from Ellington [Field, Houston, Texas] up to the Redstone Army Airport. And, incidentally, began to formulate the rules for flying after diving for astronauts. After you’d been submerged in the water tank at forty feet of water, how long did you have to go before you flew back to JSC in a T-38 without getting the bends? Dealt with problems like that. At the working level, we had a great relationship and made a lot of good friends."

        "utterance": "Here we go. May 14, 1973, we are watching the Skylab go off from the roof of the MSOB [Manned Spacecraft Operations Building]. Looked great, it was a nice day. We went back downstairs and got some headsets on and followed the progress. We missed the part about the G-spike during launch, and the thing arrived in orbit and everything seemed to be okay until they started to deploy the various parts of it, at which point—let’s see what the sequence was. I don’t remember when in the sequence the ATM was erected. I know you know this. I’ll try and draw a mental picture. In the Skylab stack was the same booster as the one that went to the Moon, but up in front of the command module where the lunar module had been stored for the missions to the Moon, the solar physics module, called the ATM, Apollo telescope module, was stored instead, and surrounded by four pieces of fairing, just as the LM was.\\n\\n After orbital insertion, those four pieces were jettisoned, exposing the ATM. The ATM was then ratcheted out ninety degrees with electric motors, and locked into place at right angles to the long axis of the Skylab, and then its solar panels were unfolded. I don’t remember whether that happened first or not, but it happened normally. There was no problem with that.\\n\\n Down on the workshop, the main solar panels that accounted for about 60 percent of the available power, maybe 65 percent, were inside big solar panel covers that were folded down flush with the sides of the workshop. Over the top of, in addition to the third stage, made specially for Skylab, which was a heat shield/micrometeorite shield, a stout aluminum shield that was carefully folded in over the workshop, the process was, first you deploy the solar panel covers out away, and the solar panels themselves come out, and then you pop that heat shield out about six inches on spring-loaded standoffs from the surface of the S-IVB. It acts like a thermos bottle, as an insulating device, reflecting sunshine and keeping the inside of the workshop at normal cool temperatures, and it provide an additional micrometeorite shield.\\n\\n But something went awry during launch with the heat shield. The kind of rough stories you hear afterwards. Well, the designers of the heat shield didn’t talk to the aerodynamicists and they didn’t properly protect the heat shield from the supersonic windstream. When the vehicle went supersonic, we got some windstream under the leading edge of the heat shield, and it just ripped right off the spacecraft. When it ripped around to one of the solar panels, it carried it off with it at the shoulder, so we lost one panel. When it got to the other panel, thank the Lord, it ripped around it instead and preserved that panel, but riveted it almost completely shut. A piece of aluminum with a rivet at one end literally wrapped it to this solar panel cover and held it down.\\n\\n So they got into orbit, commanded the solar panel covers to open. They got no response from one and they got a little trickle of power from the solar panel on the other side. The thing had opened, as it turned on, about a foot and then jammed. Then the temperatures inside began to climb.\\n\\n It wasn’t too long before the ground put together the story that the heat shield had come off. They had apparently lost one solar panel. They apparently had not lost the other one. They had some Air Force satellite reconnaissance photographs that gave them blurry pictures that sort of verified that. They were able to put together a pretty accurate guess as to what had happened.\\n\\n Meanwhile, it became apparent that afternoon that we weren’t going anywhere the next day. This was not ready for a crew and might never be. So our first duty was to our families, who were having the pre-flight cocktail party at Patrick Air Force Base [Florida]. We called them up and said, “You can keep having your party, but we’re not launching tomorrow. You can go on home.”\\n\\n In fact, the next morning, we got in our T-38s and flew back to Houston and joined the team that was going to try and figure out this problem and what to do about it. It was a great team. I look on Apollo 13 as the supreme test and mission for the mission control team. The Skylab problem was the supreme test for the engineering team. Both the contractors and the civil servants joined together as one, and they figured out what the problem was, and they developed three different solutions to the problem, in terms of what can we bring up that the crew can deploy over the warm side of Skylab to cool it down so that we can get on with the mission, (A). And, (B), how can we get that solar panel unstuck?\\n\\n We had different teams working both of them. Marshall developed a sail that required a space walk to install it. JSC had two ideas. One was this umbrella thing that was stored in a box originally designed for an experiment. You pushed it with push rods, out an airlock on the sunny side, and when it was fully deployed, springs made it sort of fall open. It was made of fishing poles and springs and the thinnest nylon they could find. Jack [A.] Kinzler invented it. It worked. It was the first thing we used, and it worked. We had a third solution that was never used, that was a sail to be deployed from the side hatch of the command module, flying around the Skylab. Whose idea was that? Max [Maxime A.] Faget’s idea. We launched with it, but we never used it.\\n\\n It was great to see the interaction. We went down to Huntsville, we the prime crew, and we did the underwater testing of the sail in the water and blessed it. Said, “Yes, we can do that. It’s feasible.” It was kind of a weird ten days. The press was trying to get all over us and Deke was trying to keep us from the press. In going to Huntsville, we broke our quarantine just a little bit. Nobody got sick, so it didn’t matter. We’d stayed on our diet pretty well.\\n\\n The guys at JSC did their thing. The launch opportunities for the crew were at five-day intervals, based on the orbital geometry of when the thing came back over the Cape. In five days, it was clear that we weren’t ready yet. These things hadn’t been designed and tested. But by ten days, we were ready, and not only were we ready, but it was getting to be now or never time, because meanwhile, the mission control team had been trying to find the appropriate attitude for Skylab, cocked far enough away from the sun to avoid over-temperaturing everything. They were losing batteries and control relay modules, and the catsup was getting contaminated. [Laughter] The vitamins were leaching out of the food, for crying out loud.\\n\\n But if they got too far away, the remaining solar panels, the ones on the ATM, were producing such a small amount of power that, again, the batteries were beginning to run down. So they played this attitude-control game for ten days, and hosed out a lot of the precious propellant on the workshop which was nitrogen gas and could not be replenished. I think we had used 60 percent of it or so by the time we arrived, after ten days. That’s scary, because this was a one-year mission. But they did the job and held it long enough.\\n\\n On launch day, now May 25th, we showed up at the launch pad and there was practically nobody there. This was the least well-attended Apollo launch in history, because everybody had to go home and put the kids back in school, you know. So it was a very peaceful morning. We arrived at the command module and looked inside, and it was a sea of brown rope under the seats, and under the brown ropes were all these different umbrellas and parasols and sails and rope, and also the equipment that we had selected to try and free up the solar panel, which was a pretty eclectic collection of aluminum poles that could be connected together, and a Southwestern Bell Telephone Company tree-lopper, with brown ropes to open and close the jaws, and all that stuff. They handed us the checklist and said, “This is how to operate that stuff.” [Laughter] Some of it we’d seen, some of it we hadn’t.\\n\\n They checked the wind very carefully on our launch day, because the space under the couches on the command module were supposed to be kept open, so that if you had a launch abort very early in the launch, and landed on the beach instead of in the water, it was a very hard landing. The couches were built to stroke, to prevent over-stressing the crew. Our couches weren’t going to stroke. There was too much stuff under there, so they had to make sure that in case of an early abort, we’d land in the water instead of on the land. We said that was okay. We didn’t care. And off we went.\\n\\n That was a great engineering triumph. I don’t know if the paperwork ever got done on this stuff, but it was quickly, carefully, collegially done. Everything we tried up there turned out to work. We had a very exciting first day, kind of a long first day. It was an eight hour or so rendezvous. Good rendezvous, nothing in particular to talk about.\\n\\n I took my Scopedex tablet prophylactically against space motion sickness shortly after orbital insertion, about the time we took our helmets and gloves off, because I had been moderately susceptible to seasickness, and I thought, “I am not going to get sick on this mission and screw it all up.” I popped my pill and thought no more about it. It was such a tense mission, I think our levels of adrenaline were already very high and stayed high that entire first day. Pete, of course, was an experienced crew member who hadn’t had the problem before. Paul and I were both rookies. We did not get motion sick. We didn’t even get close to getting motion sick. I didn’t even think about it after I took my pill.\\n\\n So I spent the eight hours before rendezvous removing brown rope and blankets, and identifying equipment, and sort of sorting it out for the way it should be when we got there. Pete steered us up to the spacecraft and we did a fly-around, Pete flying around and describing what he saw while Paul Weitz—we did have a TV camera—and Paul would hold the TV camera out the right side command module window and send some TV data back to the ground. This was extremely useful. It confirmed exactly what was going on, showed the solar panel cover, showed the one strap of aluminum that was holding it up and where it was, and allowed them to design the EVA that we were going to do two weeks later.\\n\\n We then soft-docked. I won’t describe that in detail, but it’s a partially docking. Sat there for an hour or so discussing with the ground—we had lunch at that point—what we were going to do. We decided that it was worth trying an EVA to open the side hatch of the command module and use one of the tools we had, which was sort of a shepherd’s crook on a five-foot pole, to try and pry that solar panel up. We didn’t know how much force it was stuck down with.\\n\\n So we tried it. We got our helmets and gloves back on, checked the suits out, and opened the side hatch. Paul Weitz had the shepherd’s crook, I had Paul by the legs, and Pete, of course, was flying the spacecraft.\\n\\n He’d fly it up within a couple of feet of the solar panel, and Paul would put his shepherd’s crook out there and get it hooked under the free edge. He’d pull back, and the two spacecraft would come together, and there would be jet firings everywhere. [Laughter] Conrad would say, “Oh my God.” We never collided or anything, but it was fairly sporting. Tried that two or three times, and it was obvious that it was stuck too hard and this was not going to work, unfortunately. So we subsided, closed the hatch, re-pressurized. Pete got himself a little ear block, I think, on that occasion, but he didn’t say anything about it until the next day.\\n\\n We said, “Okay, that’s not going to work. Let’s go back and dock and just proceed with activation, and we’ll go to Plan B.” That’s where we went back to dock and the docking winches didn’t work. Oh my God. They had worked the first time, for the soft docking. This time they didn’t work. So here we are up there, now we’d been up for, I don’t know, eighteen hours or something already, and it’s getting late. He tries it soft and he tries it hard. We tried all the backup means in the book. We finally got to the last backup, which required another EVA. It required that we de-pressurize the spacecraft again, because we now have to go up into the tunnel hatch, remove that hatch, get up into the docking probe itself, and cut a couple of wires.\\n\\n We had looked at this procedure once on the ground. I’ll never forget it or the guy who did it. We were over in Building 5, in the mockups, going through some of the arcane maintenance procedures. He says, “You guys have never looked at this backup docking procedure. Let me show you where things are.” So he showed us where the wires were, and he showed us where the jumper cable went in down in the right-hand equipment bay.\\n\\n We said, “Okay. Now we’re up here, we’re going to actually do this.” So back on go the helmet and gloves, down comes the hatch. This time I am up there, because I’m in the middle seat and it’s most convenient for me. I cut the wires and put the hatch back on. What it does is, this bypasses a relay that requires the capture latches to be mated before the main latches can activate. So we’ve solved that, and now he has to dock once more and keep, with the hand controller, keep the RCS [reaction control system] jets forcing the probe to collapse against the docking ring, and hopefully, when it collapses fully, the main latches will now latch on their own.\\n\\n So we go in, he’s got it knocked, he’s right in the middle. He’s one, two, three, four—they said to give it ten seconds—five, six, seven, rat-rat-rat-rat-rat. There’s machine-gun noise, which is all twelve of those docking latches. We said, “Thank God. We don’t have to go home tomorrow.” Because you know, they were saying, “Stand off a couple of miles. We’ll have another look in the morning, but we might have to bring you home.” The whole mission would have been a disgraceful failure.\\n\\n But we were docked. We were hard-docked, and from that point on, Houston was as happy as we were. They said, “Grab a bite to eat, go to sleep in the command module. We’ll start activation tomorrow morning.” So we were off. By that time, you know, we’d had a long day, a very exciting day, two EVAs on day one. You’re not allowed to do an EVA until day four on the Shuttle, because you might get sick. And a good night’s sleep, a really good night’s sleep the first day in space. I think that’s what kept this crew from having any motion sickness problems, even in the great big old workshop, where they sort of expected it. Didn’t have anything."

        "utterance": "Checking pressure in the Skylab. Opening the hatches that are on the command module side and on the Skylab side. Getting into the multiple docking adapter, checking things out there, and then a very careful procedure for sampling the air in the workshop through the hatch. They were afraid that this excess temperature had leached out some potentially damaging chemicals from the walls of the workshop, and they had carefully and quickly got together some draeger tubes. They’re glass tubes with reagent in them, through which you suck a certain amount of air and it’ll measure for a specific reagent. We sampled that air through the relief valve in the workshop hatch, found that there were no measurable levels of—I can’t remember what the chemical was anymore. So then opened that hatch and Weitz, as the system expert, went down first, and then Conrad followed, and then I was the last one to go down. The other main job that day was to get that parasol pushed out through the sunny-side airlock and deployed.\\n\\n The temperature, of course, was still between 125 and 130 down there in the workshop, so it was really hot. You had to go down and work for fifteen or twenty minutes, and then come back to the docking adapter, which was cool, in the sixties, and relax and had a drink.\\n\\n So they did that, got the thing set up. My job at that point was to go back into the command module, where out the right side window I could just barely see down the long axis of the workshop, and I could see the corners of this thing coming out, and, in fact, took some movies of it. Said, “Yes, yes, it’s out. Okay, it’s flattening out now.” See it bounce around a little bit and settle down. So getting that out was the big job.\\n\\n And then the job for the next three days or so was activation, bringing all the systems up and taking all the launch pins and other things out, just methodically checking it. It took longer than we thought, because getting used to moving your body and doing those tasks in weightlessness takes a couple of repetitions to do. No real problems, just slow. Then we started in doing medical experiments.\\n\\n We couldn’t do much by way of earth resources experiments, because we were seriously underpowered. Power was still a big problem. They were very, very careful with us, making sure that we didn’t turn on too many lights at one time. We were not allowed to use the food or drink heaters down in the galley. We ate our food at room temperature. That was okay. There were certain experiment combinations that had to be prohibited.\\n\\n We could do some Apollo Telescope Mount work, and we started in doing that, but doing the Earth camera passes required that you take the whole spacecraft out of its sun-pointing attitude. The normal attitude for Skylab was with the sunny side pointing at the sun all the time. Solar inertial. To do proper earth resources, you go into what they called a Z-local vertical, where the bottom side of the spacecraft is now rotating at the same rate you’re going around the world, so it’s pointed at the ground and you can pick out ground targets. We weren’t allowed to use the word \"targets,\" said to be too militaristic. But this is what we were doing, picking up ground features and photographing them with special films and multispectral cameras and all that stuff. Well, if you go out of the solar inertial attitude, you begin to lose power. The batteries drop off the line. It’s a disaster. We tried it once, and it took us the rest of the day to recover. We didn’t try it again until after we had freed up the solar panel.\\n\\n So the first two weeks, we were still in the dark. We still hadn’t solved all the problems, so there was still tension. We were doing the exercise thing. We had a half-day off around day eight or nine, and we gave the ground a little television show. Weitz had a taped copy of “Thus Spake Zarathustra.” It was the theme for 2001: [A Space Odyssey], [Richard] Strauss. We played that real loud, and we set up the TV camera, and we came down into the workshop for the docking the day after and we did our acrobatics thing. See, we had learned how to do it in the first week, and the ground thought that was neat. So it relaxed everybody.\\n\\n But we were still a troubled mission until we got to the point of, I think it was about June 10th, when we got ready to go out the door. Rusty [Russell L.] Schweickart had led the backup crew, again in the Marshall water tank, knowing what the problem was, to devise an EVA where we could go out, work our way around to that side of the workshop. There were no handholds, no footholds, no visual aids, no lights, because there was never any planned maintenance on Skylab. Too dangerous. There was, fortunately, planned EVA. It was to retrieve film and exchange film in the ATM. So we had the suits, we had the umbilicals, and we brought up some tools that we thought we’d need.\\n\\n They planned an EVA that had us erect a twenty-five-foot pole, put the cable cutter on the end of it, and the jaws, which are about three inches long, had to close around that aluminum scrap that we’d seen, and bite halfway into it but not all the way. That was step one.\\n\\n Now we had a handrail. Pete could go along the handrail while I stabilized the near end of it, with another rope attached to his sleeve. When he got as far out as he could, taking care to avoid sharp edges, please, he would hook that rope into the solar panel cover as far down as possible, so as to give it some leverage from the hinge. Because what we had to do was not only cut the scrap, but then break up that hinge which had frozen, and start the thing up. He was to go down, put the rope on, then I would tie the other end of the rope up to a handy stanchion, as close to the surface as possible, and then the two of us would get under the rope and stand up and hope for the best. That was the Rusty Schweickart solution. We said, “Well, okay, Rusty, we’ll give it a go.”\\n\\n *And out we went with all the equipment. I even had a dental saw from the medical kit taped to the chest of my suit, just in case, if all else failed, we thought maybe we could go down there with the dental saw and try to get that thing off. Didn’t have to use it. Did have a couple extra tethers, six-foot equipment tethers, with hooks on both ends. This proved to be crucial to the mission. Because we went out there. Getting around to the area was no problem. Erecting the twenty-five-foot-long pole with the ropes and all that was no problem.\\n\\n But getting those jaws—and we were a good twenty feet away and couldn’t get any closer to the aluminum strap—getting the jaws onto the strap at a twenty-foot distance with a pole with no foot restraints just was proving impossible. I had the pole in my hand and I would move it toward the jaws, trying to gauge whether I was exactly far enough there, and as I did that, my body would start turning. Newton’s third law. Conrad was trying to grab my legs with one arm and a strut with another arm, but that’s not a stable enough platform. We went nuts for one whole day-side pass and failed, just didn’t do it.\\n\\n It comes night-side, we’re sitting around thinking about it. We found an eyebolt, a circular bolt which just looks like the end of a Yale lock, on the surface of the workshop near one of the antennas, right in a line. Don’t know what it’s there for, but what if we strapped myself to that eyebolt? So we got the spare tether, and there’s a hook on the front of the suit. Hooked it through there, ran it through the eye bolt, back up through the suit, tightened it up, and now I have a three-point suspension. Now I can stand. I’ll place my feet on the surface of the workshop and almost straighten my knees all the way out, and suddenly I’m as stable as a rock. It was like standing in your garden at home. It was wonderful. Man, two minutes later, the job was done.\\n\\n The rest of it unfolded, as I said. We crawled under the rope that Pete had laid out. That was probably the most dangerous part of the spacewalk, was Pete going down there amid all that debris, but he got away with it. We stood up, and suddenly it released on us. We both went ass over teakettle into outer space. But our EVA system was an umbilical, a nice stout umbilical with an eighth-inch steel cable in the middle of it, so we didn’t have any worries about that. We went out to the end of our umbilicals, and then hand-over-handed ourselves back till we got something to hang onto. Turned around, and the prettiest sight I’ve ever seen in my life was that solar panel cover fully deployed, ninety degrees, and you could see the panels starting to come out as they warmed up in the sun. And we knew we had done the job. So that was great.\\n\\n We finished the EVA. It was rather a short EVA. We actually went down to the sun end of the ATM, to sort of have a pre-look at the film-retrieval route and see whether that was all okay. I will mention that I was allowed to do that, because I had trained for it. You go up to the sunny end of the ATM. It’s the middle of the day now, so this thing is pointed at the sun, and the Earth is now below you. You get up and stand in foot restraints up there, and you are king of the hill. I mean, here you are, standing up, looking down, and here’s the world spread out, horizon to horizon. There’s nothing like looking at the world through the helmet of a space suit. It’s much better than the hatch. You just feel like you’re in the middle of this big Cinerama movie. That was a heck of an experience. Described the color and condition of the parasol, and took a general look around and then went back in. It was over in less than three hours, but that was the best day of the flight."

        "utterance": "It was excellent. Again, another gold star for the people at Marshall. Good mockups. This is a truism by now; it’s harder to do it under water than it is to do it in space, because no matter how well they weight you out, you’re not really weightless. If your body is turned upside down, yes, the suit is neutrally buoyant, but you’re jammed up against the shoulders and the blood is rushing to your head. If you can do it under those circumstances, you’re going to find that it’s a piece of cake in zero-G. The suit worked perfectly, and the tools worked as advertised, and the EVA trail was great up to the ATM, to do what we had. Everybody gets 100 percent.\\n\\n There were a lot of gold stars issued on Skylab, overall. The habitability provisions were excellent. The food and water and waste management, and crew and equipment restraints, all of that stuff, a lot of thought was given to it. A lot of stuff that’s considered standard on Shuttle today was invented by these engineers who did Skylab. And it was a palatial living experience compared to either Shuttle, and I think even International Space Station. We had tons of volume. We had a good atmosphere, had a quiet spacecraft. It was a very pleasant place to live and work."

        "utterance": "Close enough to do 100 percent of the job, yes. It turned out that the missing solar panel gave you essentially a margin, so we didn’t have the margin, but we had enough we could turn the lights on, we could heat up the food, we could do the earth resources passes, and so the rest of the mission was just catch-up, just working through the days, doing as much as we could. Houston thought we were wonderful, so they didn’t get on our backs if we goofed, which we did a couple times.\\n\\n We fell into a routine. It’s amazing how quickly you fall into a routine. About eight days after the EVA, we were sitting around at the dinner table, and somebody says, “God, it’s been day twenty-two forever up here, hasn’t it?” [Laughter] Because we were doing the medical experiments and we’re doing the ATM experiments, and things have just fallen into a routine, and we’re getting sort of ready to come home.\\n\\n So the phone rings, so to speak, and Houston calls, and they said, “Guys, we’ve been thinking about extending you for a week. Just in case we have to truncate the final part of the Skylab mission, would you guys be willing to stay up for thirty-five days?”\\n\\n We looked at each other like that, and Pete said, “Absolutely, Houston. No sweat. No problem. We can handle it.” Which we could, of course. For some reason, they talked that over and decided that, no, it wasn’t necessary. Things were looking fine, and they did not ask us to stay up extra.\\n\\n So we finished our routine, got to the day before reentry, which was basically deactivation day, powering down, taking a lot of close-out photos, getting rid of all the trash, getting ready for a short night, because we’d been on a twenty-four-hour day, getting up at 6 a.m. Houston time, no matter where you were around the world, and going to bed, at least saying goodbye to Houston at 10 p.m. Houston time, and now we were faced with having to get up at what amounted to two in the morning in order to get ourselves in phase for the reentry.\\n\\n Not a big deal, but we nearly had a disaster. The trash on Skylab was all stored in the oxygen tank. Remember now that this is a third-stage booster. We are living in the large hydrogen tank. Underneath the hydrogen tank between it and where the engine used to be is a spherical tank, which was the LOX [liquid oxygen] tank. Instead of using it with an engine on the other end, they just put an open grating, so it was constantly exposed to vacuum, but physical stuff couldn’t get out. They put a trash airlock in between the hydrogen tank and the oxygen tank, so that you could open a top hatch, put a bag of trash in there, close the top hatch, seal it, then open a bottom hatch and with a plunger, push whatever it was out into the oxygen tank and it stayed there forever. That’s how we disposed of our trash without littering orbit.\\n\\n It worked fine, until the very last day when some large object, we were disposing of some large object that was just small enough to fit in there but it had edges on it. Weitz put it in there, and he closed the top hatch. He opened the bottom hatch, and he went to plunge it with the plunger, and it wouldn’t plunge. It wouldn’t go through. It was stuck. It was stuck halfway through the bottom hatch, and it looked very much as if we had just destroyed the trash provisions on Skylab, because you couldn’t open the top hatch, you were exposed to vacuum. The bottom hatch was open and it wouldn’t close. God. The crews went over to the trainer to try and figure, Weitz is jiggering this thing, and we’re saying, “Are we going home tomorrow or not? Are we going home tomorrow or not? What are we going to do?” Somehow, somehow, three hours later, he jiggered something and it went on through. We closed it and said, “Yay! We’re going home after all.” And that was that. It was routine.\\n\\n So, day twenty-eight, we get up early in the morning, finish the deactivation, get in the command module, and depart. Do a fly-around, take some nice pictures, it looks beautiful. We’re rehearsing the reentry stuff. People have not been up there twenty-eight days before, and we weren’t quite sure what kind of shape we were going to be in. So we did a two-stage de-orbit from Skylab. Skylab was at 235 nautical miles, and they decided to do a service module burn to lower us to about 120 miles, and then another burn to do the final de-orbit. It was a service propulsion system burn. Even on a fairly lightweight, empty service module, it’s only about a 1-G. We’re taking it in the couches lying sideways.\\n\\n So he lights up the service module, service propulsion engine, and two of us grayed out. Damnedest thing I ever saw. Your visual field contracts like it does when you’re pulling Gs in an airplane. That’s all. It just grayed out and then went back, but we said, “Are we that sensitive to gravity after twenty-eight days in space? This is very strange.” I remember Pete and I going through the switchology, making sure that if one of us stayed conscious, he wanted to be absolutely certain to hit that entry switch to auto so the valves would close and all of that stuff. We were a little bit concerned about reentry at that time, being something that we might not tolerate. Of course, we didn’t share our concerns with Houston.\\n\\n Around we go, and it’s time for reentry and the second service module burn. It’s not a problem. We come into the atmosphere in a very gradual buildup of G-forces to about four and a half Gs, and nobody had the slightest bit of problem. So I still can’t explain that little gray-out that we had on the first burn. I guess you might say it was just sort of settling the blood back where it belonged, you know.\\n\\n Normal, routine landing. We landed so close to the carrier, they almost had to move to avoid our landing on the flight deck. This was the first mission at which the command module would be picked up by a shipboard crane, and actually settled down onto a place on the flight deck, and then we would get out. All the previous missions, they had sent a chopper out with rafts, and you got on a raft and then up into the chopper. They figured they would go easy on us, since we’d been up there for a month.\\n\\n We’re all ready to go, and I’m thinking, “You know, we’re going to be dehydrated. We’ve lost a lot of fluid. I think I’ll chug-a-lug a strawberry drink after we touch down.” That was the wrong thing to do. I should have chug-a-lugged the damn strawberry drink with breakfast that morning instead, but I had it on the gently bobbing command module, and I got seasick and didn’t feel very good.\\n\\n So, but anyway, they opened the hatch, we all got out and went down into the sick bay, where we were supposed to go, and threw up. [Laughter] Worried Dr. Berry a little bit, but it was just that I got seasick from drinking strawberry drink."

        "utterance": "Unless I got very detailed, there wasn’t much to tell about that. You brief the ongoing crew about where things are, what the hard and easy things were to do. Told them to exercise more and that sort of thing. They were raring to go.\\n\\n We had one little interesting episode. The third day, they helicoptered us from the Coral Sea back to San Clemente, California, where Richard Nixon was having a conference with the premiere of Russia, Mr. [Leonid] Brezhnev. He wanted to introduce the Skylab crew just down from our successful mission to Mr. Brezhnev, so off we went on the chopper and down. We were wearing these masks. You’re supposed to wear the masks to prevent yourself from getting infected, because you’re still part of a medical experiment. It’s going to be another eighteen days before you’re off the diet and they stop collecting everything you put out. If you got a disease, that might interfere with the experiment.\\n\\n We’re out of the chopper, and we’re walking toward this little stand where we could see the President and Brezhnev there, and Conrad says, “I don’t like this. This is insulting to the President of the United States. Let’s take these damn things off and put them in our pockets.” So we did. [Laughter] Dr. Berry probably had a heart attack, but they didn’t give us any diseases, and we didn’t give them any diseases, and we had this brief conversation with these two guys.\\n\\n Pete angled an invitation from Brezhnev for us to come to Russia. Sure enough, the following year, we got this invitation to join a group, with our wives, and had a very interesting tour of Russia at the peak of the Cold War. That’s another story. It has nothing to do with the space program.\\n\\n Going on from there, I guess I didn’t contribute much of anything to the rest of the Skylab program. Starting to get ready for Shuttle. Starting to redefine the crew positions because we’re now going to bring in non-career astronauts, call them payload specialists. There was a lot of activity on what to call them, how to train them, how to integrate them, how to define and divide the tasks between career scientists, like we felt we were, and non-career scientists, like the new ones were going to be. Of course, there’s so much water over the dam since those early efforts, the Shuttle has pretty well ironed out all those problems, until we get into a new set of problems with Space Station and with international crews. That will all be very interesting.\\n\\n So I was involved with preparing for Shuttle. In charge of the space and life sciences directorate during the early Shuttle years. But I can’t think of anything spectacular to tell you about those years. Everything went pretty well routinely, waiting for Space Station. Waiting for the follow-on to Skylab, at least from my perspective, that was the big thing. We were very happy when [President Ronald W.] Reagan announced in 1984 the permanent presence in space, authorizing NASA to begin the process of developing a space station.\\n\\n I think we have not performed in the most stellar fashion in the last sixteen and a half years. We should be there by now. I’m not blaming anything on the current administration or leadership, because I think our problems started right back in ’84, when in an effort to gain a constituency for a space station, a new major project for NASA, NASA went out and beat the bushes and made promises to every constituency they could think of to get a lot of people to sign up and say, “We’ll use a space station.” And they got a set of missions that couldn’t possibly be accomplished within the budget.\\n\\n They tried to design, for $8 billion, a space station that was all things to all people. Some of those earlier design concepts have to be seen to be believed. They had external hangars for maintaining interplanetary spacecraft, and all kinds of astronomy and planetary micrometeorite collection, and huge numbers of modules and acres of solar panels, and you just couldn’t do it.\\n\\n They never quite got the thing under control in terms of budget and schedule. I think they would have done, except for the\\n\\n Challenger\\n\\n accident. Early 1986, boom. Here comes the\\n\\n Challenger\\n\\n accident, and it just turns NASA upside down. Never before that had anybody thought that NASA was less than the best-managed federal agency ever. Immediately after, we found that we were the worst federal agency ever. You know, the atmosphere just turned around completely.\\n\\n In its terrible and ultimately successfully efforts to get out from under the\\n\\n Challenger\\n\\n accident and get back to flight, the Space Station program was an orphan. It was not well managed or surveilled in those days. There was change of leadership at Headquarters, and I think some decisions were made about Space Station that weren’t properly looked at. Some other decisions were made about Space Station management as a result of the\\n\\n Challenger\\n\\n accident that were inappropriate and have since been reversed. We ended up with a Freedom Program that had an ungainly management structure, an unnecessary layer of management at the Headquarters level, which has since gone away, and a configuration that was very difficult to build.\\n\\n I also think that by January 1993, the program, in spite of the management problems, had learned how to manage. They were making real progress toward critical design review, and the impression I had was, “Yes, we’re over budget. We’re behind schedule. But we have learned how to do this thing, and we’re going to be successful.” And in comes a new administration and decides that the only way to save the Space Station is to give half of it away to the Russians. I think that was a diplomatic move, not an engineering move, and the amount of pain that it will cause us is yet to be determined.\\n\\n We’re working away manfully to try and make that thing work. I am working away manfully to try and make it work. I hope it will work. In retrospect, it’s sort of crying over spilt milk. Perhaps one could say that we should have started on a little more modest scale with the permanent space station, more on the scale of Skylab, as a matter of fact. More the way the Russians did with Mir. Put a core module up and build on it as your capability and your needs expand. This, in fact, is what we may end up doing with the International Space Station, in spite of the grandiose look of it in viewgraphs today.\\n\\n I think the permanent presence is important. I think it is a valid way-station to planetary exploration and will be a very useful national laboratory in weightlessness. It certainly has taken us a long time to get there."

[Laughter] People still come and ask for data. “How did you guys do that? How did you manage this? Give us a little seminar, get some people together, and tell us about managing science on the Skylab. How did you manage to do that so efficiently? What did you do wrong, that we shouldn’t repeat?” We had a lot of things that we did wrong that should not be done that way again.\\n\\n So I figure that once the International Space Station has been in operation for about two years, Skylab will be as interesting as Columbus’ voyage. [Laughter] All those lessons will have been learned over again and new ones will be being learned. But now we’re still popular, so it’s kind of fun."

        "utterance": "In a number of ways. That could be another long reminiscence, but briefly to snapshot, the initial astronauts were selected in total ignorance, not stupidity but ignorance, about what the environment was like or what it was going to take. So they did every difficult, nasty test they could think of, just to try and screen those people down to seven who could stand hot, cold, acceleration, disorientation, etc. When the astronauts, much to their amazement and everybody else’s, discovered that they were national heroes and they hadn’t even flown yet, they fired the psychologists and sort of set the medical folks back into, “You’re nice and supporting and we realize that we have to have you around, but don’t get too ambitious.”\\n\\n A battle ground, if you will, for this over all the years has been what’s the role of exercise in space flight? The crew has always considered it just that, it’s exercise. It’s an operational thing, something we do to keep fit, and we don’t need the doctors to tell us what to do or how to do it. That was the attitude through Apollo, and even into Skylab. We agreed it was very important to measure all the exercise, but we didn’t want a prescription. We didn’t want them to tell us exactly what exercise to do. We said, “You don’t know what exercise is necessary. Let us go up there and do our thing and measure the results. From that will come, is it necessary? If so, how much? If so, what kind?”\\n\\n We’re still stuck between Skylab and Space Station because we don’t have any good long-duration experience with good data since Skylab. The Russians have some good experience, but they don’t have the organized data. So we’re right at the same point we were in 1974. We know it’s important. We know there’s going to have to be a prescription. You can’t anymore just leave it to the crew’s discretion, but we don’t know what the prescription was. So let’s go work on that. That’s, if you will, an encroachment of the doctors and physiologists back into what has been an astronaut purview up to now. I think, in that sense, there’s a better relationship, perhaps, between the docs and the crew than there was early in the program, although ours wasn’t bad.\\n\\n In another sense, the world has changed almost beyond recognition in the area of informed consent for experiments. There were no informed consent forms before Skylab. I’ve described to you how we fought and scratched on the details of medical experiments trying to make them what we thought operationally suitable as well as useful, but there was never any question that it was part of the job to go do that stuff. We never signed any consent forms.\\n\\n About two years ago, somebody from JSC asked me whether I thought I could possibly get signed agreements from the Skylab astronauts for the free use of their medical data for research purposes. I said, yes, I figure I could probably do that. We had an astronaut get-together shortly after that. In thirty minutes, I got nine guys to sign on the dotted line. “Hell, I thought it was already in the public domain.”\\n\\n The attitude is quite different and a little bit more divisive, I think, today, in that crew members feel that it’s their right, and they’re told that it’s their right, that participation in any experiment is voluntary. They have to sign informed consent, approve the protocol, and if the protocol is changed, they can change their minds. In that sense, there’s a lot more bureaucratic hassle, if you will, that stands between you and the result. Again, good will will work it out, but it’s more complicated than it used to be."

        "utterance": "Well, I think it started real early. I was always interested in airplanes and rockets and science in general. I liked taking things apart and putting them back together, if I could. I liked the sciences, physics, and chemistry. Chemistry was pretty cool, especially if I could make it loud and stinky. I built rockets, homemade rockets in junior high school, and that was cool. Some of them went up in the sky. Some of them just went “blooey” on the ground, but that was all fun.\\n\\n I think that probably the biggest scientific event in my early life was in 1957. I was fourteen years old. I was carrying papers for the\\n\\n Denver Post\\n\\n on the day that the Russians launched Sputnik, and I had 104 papers to fold and deliver, and 104 times that day I was reading about how the Russians had beat us into space, and how the United States was so far behind and the Russians were ahead, and that was really pretty depressing. I remember shivering on a cold, crystal-clear Denver [Colorado] night, looking up in the sky and watching somebody else’s first space satellite going silently overhead. I was both inspired and angered. I said, “Man, oh, man, we can do better than this,” and I kind of resolved even right then, I said, “Man, I like rockets. I want to do something to get us back ahead.”\\n\\n So I took a bunch more science classes in school. I went and learned Russian, just so perhaps I could perhaps pick up on some of the things that they had gotten ahead of us in. So I began to kind of structure my life [in that direction]. Yes, I wanted to work with rockets, work in the space program somehow."

        "utterance": "Right. I wanted to go into aeronautical engineering because I really loved airplanes, but New Mexico State didn’t have an aero engineering option, so I took mechanical engineering. That was about as close as I could get at the time. At the same time, I was taking a bunch of chemistry and chem [chemical] engineering classes. That enabled me to get a job working with the Army as a mechanical engineering co-op at the Army missile range [White Sands Missile Range, White Sands, New Mexico]. NASA White Sands [Test Facility, Las Cruces, New Mexico] had not even been built yet. And so I got to work with rockets and missiles, the real ones, not just model ones, as soon as I got into college. And boy, that was a big step up from my homemade rockets. I’m so lucky I didn’t blow myself up making my own homemade rocket fuels. At first it was kind of clandestine, just go launch them out in the back yard, but the neighbors pretty soon ratted on me, and Mom and Dad pretty soon found out, and they said, “You’re not going to do that stuff around here, [you’re going to blow us all up]!”\\n\\n And I [said], “[But Mom], I really, really want to. [I'll be careful—promise.]”\\n\\n They said, “Okay. Well, if you do it in a good, structured and safe way, we’ll let you make your own rockets.”\\n\\n And I ended up getting permission through the Army that had a test range down by Socorro [New Mexico]. I was in Albuquerque [New Mexico] at the time. They let us launch our own rockets from that gunnery range down there. I had already joined the National Association of Rocketry, which is an amateur rocketry group. So, in 1960, I built a series of rockets, which were actually pretty cool for a high school kid back forty-some-odd years ago, and set at the time the unofficial altitude record for amateur rockets. Built a two-stage rocket that went over 30,000 feet high. That was fun doing it as an amateur. And then finally, by the time I got into college, [I] was able to start working with the [real] rockets and actually get paid for it."

So it was the Apollo lunar module and the command and service module. It wasn’t the big engines for the Saturn V. They couldn’t test those things out here. Those engines are just too big, and the engines put out a lot of heat. A lot of heat requires a lot of water to quench it. Also, the vehicles are so big that, you might remember, they traveled by barge. We don’t have very many barges here in New Mexico! So they focused on the smaller rocket engines for the lunar module and the command and service module. And that was really the primary focus, just rocket engine testing.

        "utterance": "Yes, sure. The actual physical facilities out there, well, first of all, the entire place we knew had been built on a temporary basis, so there [were] a lot of temporary buildings out there. There [were] a few main structures which had been intentionally built to last only a decade, but the place was growing so rapidly in the 1963 to 1966 time frame that there were way more people than there was room for. So we had huge trailer farms with these ten-by-forty office-type trailers, fifteen, twenty, thirty trailers end-to-end and side-by-side clustered around the buildings in at least three major areas.\\n\\n So, yes, there [were] a lot of people that didn’t even have offices whatsoever. A typical engineer’s “office” was not an office at all. Engineers didn’t have offices. Only managers had offices. So engineers worked in a big bullpen, which was a very large, open room with a bunch of big flat tables in the middle, typically twenty or thirty feet long, just littered with blueprints and foldout schematic diagrams showing the electrical systems or the piping runs inside the facility, or even inside a rocket test article. Then the engineers’ little spaces were around the perimeter of the room, with their backs to the data tables. Then like every ten feet or so, there was a little Plexiglas divider that separated you from your other co-worker. So all you had was a desk and maybe a little file cabinet and that was about it.\\n\\n It was constant activity and pandemonium going on back there, so there was no privacy, no quiet time. There were at least half a dozen of these mechanical calculating machines, Friden or Monroe types [in the bullpen]. So those things were constantly [going] “chuggity, chuggity, chuggity, chuggity,” [clacking away in the background, churning out numbers].\\n\\n Nobody had computers back then. We did lots of work with our slide rules and pencils and graph paper. People didn’t type things; only secretaries typed anything. Most of your reports were done in longhand and handed to a secretary, who turned it into a written report. [And almost everything was typed in duplicate with messy carbon paper in between, and if there was a mistake, it either got typed all over again or she went in and tried to make a decent-looking erasure on each page. It was usually ugly! They didn't even have \"white-out\" in those days.]\\n\\n Now, the actual rocket engine test facilities, those were really cool. Particularly in the LM test areas, we had to simulate the vacuum environment of outer space, so those rocket engines would think that they were firing in outer space. It turns out that that’s necessary because rocket engines perform better in space than they do here on Earth, and so all the rocket engine manufacturers, well, they can test their engines just by firing them on the ground and measure the performance, but once you get up into a vacuum, they perform actually even better, [primarily] because there’s no air in the way to get in the way of the rocket engine exhaust. Heat transfer is also different here on Earth where there’s air. Like air flowing over the radiator in your car to cool off, there’s no [airflow] up in space to cool off a rocket engine, so firing it in a vacuum makes a big difference.\\n\\n Well, it takes a huge facility to actually create that vacuum environment inside the big rocket engine test cell. The test cells were big enough to accommodate the entire mated lunar module. So they were like thirty-three feet in diameter, thirty-eight feet tall. You put the big test article, full scale, like a full-scale lunar module into the test cell by taking the lid off of the top and lowering it down into the test cell, bolting it into position, then closing the lid on it, and then the rocket engine fired down into a great big exhaust duct that looked like a culvert that connected to the big altitude simulation system.\\n\\n The altitude simulation system itself was a masterpiece. It was a marvel of complicated engineering. It used three converted rocket engines to create high-pressure exhaust gases of steam. It burned liquid oxygen and isopropyl alcohol to create high-pressured steam, and then they pumped 1,000 gallons per minute of water into the flame underneath [each engine] to create [even] more steam. And they pumped that steam over some orifices and a set of convergent-divergent nozzles to create the shock waves which then literally sucked, all of the air out of the test cell, and sucked all the rocket engine exhaust out at the same time. So you could fire a rocket engine in there that’s putting out twenty pounds per second of exhaust gas, and yet that altitude simulation system could continue [pulling] all that exhaust gas out and maintain an altitude similar to—simulating being over 120,000 feet above the Earth. So that was close enough to simulate being in a vacuum.\\n\\n That steam generator itself put out nearly a million horsepower. It was a deafening roar while it was operating. It spewed a [cloud] of high-pressure steam and exhaust gas for several hundred feet in the air. There was a big, huge white cloud of this steam and exhaust gas coming out from this roaring monster. People down in the administration area nearly two miles away could always tell when there was a rocket engine test firing going on because they could hear this low roar, and then look up on the horizon a couple of miles away and see this big cloud of steam and exhaust gas rising up there, and it was pretty spectacular. The ground would rumble and shake. We knew that with that much horsepower going on, that there was always a chance of some of that power getting loose. And so, yes, there were a lot of inadvertent shutdowns and minor leaks and little minor explosions and occasionally some fairly major accidents where equipment got damaged just because that was a very powerful system."

        "utterance": "Within a year or so after joining, it turns out that I was quite interested in doing some of the actual performance analysis of the vehicle, and they had a need for somebody who could technically compare how the engines did, compared with what was required out of the test objectives. So that meant starting from scratch while setting up a test. We would read through with the contractor, the engine manufacturers, what were their requirements for this test. What were they trying to demonstrate? Were they trying to demonstrate a particular sequence of events and firings called a mission duty cycle, which was the simulated firing durations and thrust levels, etc., as might be expected on a particular mission going to the Moon and returning?\\n\\n After looking at the required objectives, we would determine what kind of instrumentation is necessary to gather that information, then watch through all the installation of the instrumentation, load the vehicle with the correct amount of propellants. Sometimes we had to simulate hot or cold conditions. For example, [when the lunar module is sitting] on the Moon, one side of the vehicle is exposed to the sun, and the other side is exposed just to [the darkness of] deep space. So one side would get hot; one side would get cold. So sometimes we would have to do hot or cold propellants. [In the case of the Apollo spacecraft when it was traveling on the way to and from the Moon, they intentionally rotated the spacecraft to even out the solar heating, sort of like a rotisserie. The real term was PTC, for Passive Thermal Control, but everyone called it \"Barbeque Mode.\"]\\n\\n We would also explore the limits of the engines to see, okay, what does it do if the pressures are at the high end of the specification, or how does the engine run at the low end of its pressure or temperature envelope? There’s something called a mixture ratio, and that is the ratio of fuel to oxidizer that is being squirted into the engine. It’s sort of like the amount of gas and air that your car’s carburetor or fuel injection system gets. Anyway, so all of those things are performance parameters that need to be measured and then compared with the required specification values.\\n\\n So then after we got the vehicle loaded came the actual test. The test procedures had been worked out [weeks or months] in advance by a team of dozens of people. The test procedures were extremely detailed. A test firing document was typically sixty pages deep, and it had detailed instructions for every person in the test team and every move that they were going to make. So, for example, the test conductor would read through this—it looked just like a cookbook, and he would say, “EFCS, position valve MV-40[9] open.”\\n\\n And the technician at the EFCS (Engine Firing Control Station) would position valve MV-409 open. Click. He’d say, “MV-409 open, verified,” and a quality-assurance fellow sitting also at the console would get out his stamp and stamp that particular step that says “Verified.”\\n\\n Then they go to the next thing. It says, “Test stand 401, verify the fuel sight glass reading is 33 [+ or – 2] inches.”\\n\\n And the guy out at the test stand would radio back, “Sight glass reading is 33.3 inches,” and the quality-assurance man would stamp [that] step, and it went on that way in very detailed, formal fashion.\\n\\n My particular role during most of the firings was at—I was off in the data room where they had rows and rows of strip charts. A strip chart is just a way of displaying a particular pressure or temperature or accelerometer or strain gauge or something like that, measurement, with a moving pen on a strip of moving paper, and it rolls up past the pen and makes marks on it. There was this entire panel called TMP, test monitor panel, that had about fifty or sixty [strip chart] measurements on it all throughout the whole vehicle, pressures and temperatures in the helium system, in the rocket fuel and oxidizer tanks, and down in the engine itself, as well as a few pertinent things for the facility, particularly the altitude pressure inside the vacuum test cell.\\n\\n So I had to monitor [all] those things both during loading, so we got the right amount of propellants [and helium] aboard the vehicle, and then during the firing was when the tense times really were, because you had to be watching half a dozen different things, very powerful, very high-energy system where things, if they got out of hand, could destroy a multi-million-dollar vehicle within a couple of seconds. So I had my eyes [glued] on critical parameters during the firing, constant readouts of whether things were going okay or not.\\n\\n Then after a test was done with, we got into the data analysis portion of a test, which could take—there was always a quick-look data analysis done just that day, and that was a gross examination to see, “Okay, well, did we see anything that really looked bad? Did anything fail?” And that was combined with a visual examination of the engine and the rest of the test article.\\n\\n After the quick-look examination and a short report was written, then we’d get into the detailed performance analysis, which started out being done almost [entirely] longhand, but subsequently developed some programs for computing some of the parameters and measuring those things and displaying them out in a standardized format. So [finally] we’d have to write a big report on the test, comparing it to the performance objectives that had been set out in the original test directives."

The longest firings were probably on the order of ten minutes continuous, and that is ten tense minutes with all your fingers crossed that nothing really happens, that nothing happens out of the ordinary. So there’s weeks and sometimes even months of preparation for a firing, and then it’s all over with in twenty tense minutes.\\n\\n In many cases, you can’t go back, because those rocket engines back then, they could only be fired once. The combustion chambers were typically not made of metal like they are now. They were made out of fiberglass phenolic resin, sort of like the body on a Corvette. When the engines fired, the fire inside the combustion chamber was on the order of 5,500 degrees. Well, that’s like an acetylene torch, and it tended to melt and vaporize the [phenolic part of the] combustion chamber material.\\n\\n Well, that actual vaporization is what cooled the combustion chamber. Just like evaporation of water from your skin makes you cold, well, the evaporation of the phenolic resin out of this combustion chamber cooled the chamber, [and the heat] turned it into a charcoal briquette, but it was still stiff enough to maintain the pressure inside, [as] it [slowly] burned itself away. It was called [an] ablative material. It burned itself away during the firing and lasted just long enough to make it through the mission.\\n\\n The material was similar to that that they used on the heat shield for reentry. The heat shield was made out of those same kind of materials, and literally kind of burned themselves away, sacrificed themselves protecting the space capsule from the heat of reentry. That’s the same way that these rocket engines worked.\\n\\n But if you had done something wrong during a test or if the engine performed unexpectedly, you couldn’t just go back and repeat it, because now the engine was all cooked up and couldn’t be used again."

So you would fire it for a certain duration, then let it [rest for 2 hours or 6 hours or whatever] as if it’s coasting on the way to the Moon, and then fire it again, particularly like with the LM descent engine. That thing was throttleable, so you could run it at different power levels. Most rocket engines, they’re either all the way on or they’re all the way off. The LM descent engine, you could throttle it [from full power all the way down to 10 percent power]. And that was necessary to lower the vehicle down onto the Moon in a controlled manner. So anyway, we would run through the entire throttling sequence of the LM [descent] engine [as if it were slowing down from lunar orbit, hovering a few feet off the surface while looking for the right spot, then throttling back to gently settle on the surface].\\n\\n But anyway, all the test-readiness review [items] had to get a go-ahead for readiness from each of the major participants in a test."

Well, in a rocket engine, if that fire is flickering [or wobbling] inside the combustion chamber, that means that there may be pressure waves being set up inside the engine which can destroy the boundary layer coolant effect that protects the inside of the combustion chamber from the 5,000 degree heat of combustion and can melt it through in the space of less than a second. And they called it acoustic instability because the frequency of those combustion oscillations [was] in the range that you could hear. In fact, there [were] times when you could stand outside and listen to the engine, in addition to just the roar. If it started going unstable, you would hear the thing, and it would squeal like you stepped on a cat [Loud growl].\\n\\n Literally, you could watch some of that instability action on the test monitor panel, and you knew that that was way bad. So as soon as something like that came up, it was my responsibility to give the shutdown signal. And that was always very tense, because you were watching for that kind of stuff.\\n\\n Also, with later engines like the Shuttle [orbital] maneuvering engine, that thing used its own fuel to cool itself, sort of like pumping gasoline through the radiator of your car before you put it into the carburetor. Well, if that fuel got too hot as it passed through the passages in the cooling channels on the rocket engine, that fuel could actually detonate. Or if there [isn’t] enough fuel flowing through there and it [gets] too hot, it boils, and then it boils into vapor, and that vapor doesn’t carry any heat away, and the rocket engine overheats in that location and can burn through. So I was constantly watching some of those critical kinds of parameters.\\n\\n To me, that was a pretty important responsibility. There [were] many times when I would be watching a temperature creep way up towards a red line. The rocket engine is firing, and there’s a red line established that says, \"Don’t let the temperature get any higher than this\". And it’s creeping up, and it looks like it’s going to [keep going] and exceed that temperature, and I’ve got a responsibility. We’ve got ten more seconds left in the firing, or thirty more seconds left in the firing. Do I let it go two degrees too high? Does it look like it’s going to get too hot or [should I] just wait and see? You’ve got to kind of know the philosophy behind, why did they establish that temperature [limit] in the first place, and how firm is it? What could happen if I let it go too long?\\n\\n In some cases, if you let it go, the engine could burn through. On the other hand, if you [call] it off too soon, you may have wasted a multi-million-dollar-engine test that would have to be repeated, and they’d say, “Well, why did you shut it off so soon? It might not have gone any higher,” or something like that. So that was an important part of a real challenge during the actual rocket engine tests."

So that’s why they put the place out in the boondocks, 800 miles away, so that we would not expose a big population to these poisonous rocket fuels and the loud noises and the possibility of explosions and things like that.\\n\\n So, yes, we were totally dependent upon [the Manned Spacecraft] Center for our work direction. We conferred with those subsystem managers on a daily basis. They provided us our bread and butter. They provided us our budget [and overall project direction]. They were then, and still are, the official office for all of our hiring and firing, all the personnel records, all the legal, all the administrative support, still comes out of Houston. [But] it did more so back then than it does now. We’ve become considerably more independent. Since the demise of the Apollo Program we have taken on considerably more reimbursable work, and the place is a bit more independent, so to speak. We always had to have a real high degree of independence just to be able to survive out there 800 miles away from the parent organization. So we had our own administration group and finance group and the technical people and all that kind of stuff so that we could pretty much operate on our own out there; warehousing and logistics and maintenance and all that kind of stuff, instead of depending [entirely] upon Houston."

        "utterance": "Oh, boy. I’d only been with NASA for a few months, and so I was still really wide-eyed and impressed with all the things that were going on. Then in January of ’67 when that fire struck, boy, it was an immediate personal tragedy for everybody involved, but as soon as the shock of that tragedy wore off, boy, we immediately jumped into our role of doing—kind of a new role, of doing flammability testing on virtually every component that ever went into the test article. So that was really kind of a major watershed for us.\\n\\n We’d been doing small amounts of compatibility testing, which means making certain that materials will operate in the environment that they’re supposed to. Like if you have something that’s going to be exposed to hydrazine, well, you’ve got to test it in that rocket fuel. If it’s going to be in the crew compartment, then it has to be exposed to, in this case, pure oxygen, and particularly the behavior, the flammability behavior of materials in pure oxygen was relatively poorly understood and certainly underappreciated.\\n\\n You might remember back in high school, you might have had some chemistry experiments or something like that that showed, well, jeez, you can’t burn steel wool in air, but you just heat some steel wool and then put it into a little test tube of pure oxygen, and my golly, the thing lights up like a filament on a light bulb and burns away. So the astronauts found out the hard way that things really burn much differently in oxygen. Things that will not burn in air will burn rapidly in [pure] oxygen. In high-pressure pure oxygen, even things like stainless steel will burn like a torch. Titanium that is used in the combustors for jet engines, obviously it doesn’t burn in regular air, but in pure oxygen, titanium will burn like a Fourth of July sparkler. So things get really dangerous in oxygen. So that led to a whole new role out there at White Sands Test Facility, and that evolved into a materials testing role that is now at least 50 percent of our whole work out there.\\n\\n But since the propulsion system was not involved in the Apollo fire, that didn’t really affect my job in particular, so we didn’t have a significantly different role. The big change was up in the laboratories. So the laboratories, beginning that day, they were no longer just a support group; they had a life of their own, that was to evaluate materials.\\n\\n Yes, boy, they learned a lot from that fire. Much of it was in different materials that were more fire-resistant. There were a lot of workmanship issues also involved. But as a result, the subsequent missions did not suffer a similar kind of a problem, and given what they found, all the things that now in retrospect, we say, my golly, those were some of the wrong things to do, wrong materials, and putting some things too close to each other, and putting things in such a way that a fire could propagate very rapidly, you say “those were all the wrong things to do.” Well, we now learned what not to do, and the subsequent missions were successful because of it."

        "utterance": "The safety program was something that was there and all around us, but as a test stand engineer, I almost didn’t recognize it as an “organized program.” I just knew that there was a bunch of both contractor and NASA safety people. You could always tell them because they had a green hat or a green band on their hat. And they were around just looking over all the operations to make certain that industrial safety precautions were handled. It was just a part of life. It wasn’t something that seemed that you had to invoke specifically. They were just there all the time, but, yes, you sure did get educated real early about some of the specific hazards of working with these high-energy and poisonous propellants.\\n\\n The oxidizer is nitrogen tetroxide. It’s a relative of nitric acid, and if you get it on your skin, it burns the skin and turns it all orange and crusty, and if it gets down deep enough, it can poison your blood. But its main problem is, if you inhale it (and it boils at 70 degrees, so you almost always encounter it as a vapor), a dark reddish cloud always signified an oxidizer leak, and it smells sort of like chlorine, [but] actually it acts even worse than chlorine on your lungs. When it comes in contact with moist tissue like in your eyes or your nose or your throat or your lungs, it recombines with that moisture to form [nitric and] nitrous acids again. So if you take a deep breath of it, you end up creating nitric acid in your lungs, and so it eats you out from the inside. So it’s really pretty bad stuff.\\n\\n The fuel is equally harmful in kind of an insidious way. The fuel was unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine and hydrazine. Now, in the Shuttle Program, we use monomethyl hydrazine, but they’re all chemical relatives of each other, and they’re [all] known to cause cancer. If you get a drop of it on your skin, it makes these burns and lesions that take months and months to heal, and ooze. It’s also a blood poison and kills your liver. So it’s some way bad stuff.\\n\\n The fuel stinks. It smells like an old dead fish that’s been soaked in ammonia. [Sniffs] You can tell when you’re smelling the fuel, just because it smells rotten. But, the fuel is so bad for you, that by the time you can smell it, the detection level is greater than the exposure limit, so by the time you can smell it, you are already being exposed to more than it is allowable for a regular workday. So even back in Apollo days, and certainly now, we have automated vapor monitors going all the time, every kind of activity around there. You have these fuel and oxidizer vapor detectors. Some of the guys even carry little lapel panels sort of like a radiologist carries to measure the amount of exposure that they are being exposed to during the day, in case they get perhaps out of range of one of the monitors.\\n\\n Now, some operations required people to work where they knew that there [were] leaks of these—where they were likely to be exposed to the propellants. So, for example, if there was a leak, you had to get somebody in there to replace the fittings or replace a valve. So we had special suits for the guys, big vinyl suits that were totally enclosed, and they had their own breathing air supply inside, called a SCAPE suit, Self-Contained Atmosphere Protective Ensemble. It looked like a big [gray or] pink rubber spacesuit. And literally, they could get sprayed or splashed with the fuel or oxidizer, and it wouldn’t hurt them. You could work inside a big poisonous cloud that was so bad that if you took one deep breath, it would kill you, and the guys would work for even a couple of hours inside that [suit], totally protected.\\n\\n Everyone was well educated into the hazards about it, so people knew what the potential hazards were, how to deal with it. We had procedures to make certain that an exposure didn’t happen, but then you also had suits to protect you when that was unavoidable, and there [were] emergency procedures in case there was an accidental exposure. So we had showers all around the test stands, and so [if you got some propellant on you], all you did was just run over to this little shower, and you’d step on the little grate, and it would douse you off and rinse everything off. They had things that looked like drinking fountains, but they were eyewashes, so it would squirt water up there to get it out of your eyes.\\n\\n Luckily—we weren’t just lucky; we were good, but it helps to be lucky, too. There were some close calls, and there [were] really only a couple of serious accidents that I recall, that involved these dangerous rocket propellants. One of them happened real early in the Apollo era, just right before I got there. One of the technicians was working on a line that had the rocket oxidizer in it, and the procedure had called for some valves to be closed off so that that line didn’t have any more oxidizer in it, and drained off. So he went in there, and he had on what was called a splashsuit, which was just like a rubber rainsuit. [He] even had a splash mask on, which was a clear shield over his face so that something couldn’t come straight into his eyes or face.\\n\\n Then as he was opening one of the fittings with a wrench, it turns out that a valve had been leaking and had actually let some oxidizer back in, and he opened the fitting, thinking it was empty, and some of this liquid squirted out towards him, and it squirted him kind of—the liquid hit this rubber on the chest, and it squirted up underneath his face mask, underneath this clear face shield, and got him in the face, [right] in [the] eye.\\n\\n They rushed him off to the dispensary and cleaned everything off of him, but it couldn’t save his eye. That quick exposure ate his eyeball out. So he was blind in one eye. That fellow came back to work. They got him a—he got a glass eye. He went to work no longer working with those fuels, but [as] an electrician. He still works out there today. So he survived, but that sure was a real lesson to us, and so we never used those face shields again.\\n\\n Then there was another fellow in the very early 1970s, and he and another guy had been doing some materials compatibility tests, and that involved taking just a sample of a piece of rubber that was going to be exposed to oxidizer somewhere in the rocket engine system, and they wanted to make certain that this new kind of rubber was going to be compatible, not going to react with the oxidizer, so the way they’d they do it was they got a stainless steel bottle that was filled with the oxidizer, and then you put this little piece of rubber in it. It [was] actually a little rubber O-ring, like the washer on your faucet. Then they put a big stainless steel cap back on it and bolted it on, and they would take it down to the laboratory, and just let it sit in a temperature-controlled environment and monitor the pressure in there. So if the rubber was going to react with the oxidizer, things would decompose, and the pressure would rise inside there, and they could monitor that pressure rise in the laboratory as an indicator of compatibility. If the pressure didn’t rise, it says okay, the rubber probably is okay.\\n\\n And then at the end of a week or two or something like that, they would open the thing back up, and they’d take out the little rubber washer, and they’d measure it to see if it swelled up like rubber does in gasoline or something like that, or see if it shrunk up and turned hard. And they’d also do some chemical analysis on the oxidizer to make certain that some of it hadn’t dissolved into the oxidizer. So that was a way that the test was supposed to go.\\n\\n So this one particular day, the guys had gone and they plunked the little rubber washer into the stainless steel canister, which is about three or four inches in diameter, about a foot long, it has a three-quarter-inch-thick stainless steel cap bolted onto the top of it, and then put in there, bolted the cap on it, and they’d done this for a couple of samples, and then it was break time.\\n\\n So they had these called Hoke bottles—H-O-K-E was the name of the manufacturer—in the back of the pickup truck, and they were sitting on the tailgate of the pickup truck, union break time, and smoking a cigarette, and without any warning, there was this big explosion in the back of the truck. The rubber sample had been reacting violently, [but] they couldn’t tell it because it’s inside a stainless steel container. It blew the end—blew that big three-quarter-inch-thick four-inch diameter steel disc, weighed about a pound or so, blew it all the way through Jimmy Carrillo. It blew it through his back, out the front, largely disemboweled him. It [barely] missed his spine.\\n\\n He maintained consciousness! He was still conscious! His buddy stuffed as much as possible back into his body, wrapped his shirt around him very tightly, drove him rapidly to the dispensary. The nurse at the dispensary kept him engaged and conscious so that he did not lapse into shock. They got him to the hospital. They did, obviously, lots of emergency surgery on him. He came back six months later, minus about twenty feet of intestines, with a colostomy bag, and went back to work for us. [His courage and dedication and attitude]—it was pretty moving. [I was so proud of him for that.] Anyway, boy, did we ever learn a lot. You learned something from that, too.\\n\\n But anyway, those are the only two significant incidents throughout the thirty-six years that I’ve been there and the nearly [forty] years that the whole base has been in operation. So I think attests well to the overall safety program. Like I say, it was not as organized as it is right now, but I think it was still pretty darn effective."

        "utterance": "During the Apollo missions, the White Sands Test Facility maintained our test articles in a flight configuration with the propellants at the same load levels and temperatures as the actual vehicles. At least that was kind of the intent. So that if a problem were to occur in the flight, that then they could perhaps quickly call back to White Sands and say, “Hey, we’ve got this kind of a problem going on. See if you can simulate it.”\\n\\n Well, it turned out that the time lag between discovering a problem in space and trying to set up and simulate it back here was just too great. There was just no way to simulate the stuff in real time. So that turned out to be not really so valuable. Now, we, the [WSTF (White Sands Test Facility)] base, did indeed then do a lot of post-flight anomaly resolution, so if a problem had come up during a flight, like a regulator is supposed to maintain a helium pressure at a certain level, and, jeez, the thing failed, and it ran away, and the secondary regulator had to catch it, well, we would try to simulate the conditions that did that. Sometimes that meant inducing an intentional failure somewhere else to see, well, did that trigger the event? But those were [usually] kind of post-flight operations.\\n\\n During an actual Apollo mission, at least on two occasions, I was lucky enough to be asked to participate in an actual flight as a consultant on the LM engines, particularly the LM ascent and descent and reaction control engines. So that was really pretty cool.\\n\\n Going back to the White Sands [role] after [a] mission, we at White Sands were often requested to go back and simulate a portion of a flight to see if we could replicate a problem and come up with a solution, and so if a procedural or hardware change was necessary, we did some follow-on testing to make sure that the proposed fix really did work as planned. An example of that was, you might recall right after they landed on the Moon, they had to dump the pressure out of the helium pressurization system, called supercritical helium. Well, that venting of that pressure forces ultra, ultra cold helium gas through a heat exchanger, which is full of rocket fuel. But the rocket fuel is no longer flowing, and so it would freeze. [The ultra-cold helium] froze the [fuel in the] heat exchanger, making a block of ice, trapping the liquid rocket fuel between the closed-off engine valve and this block of ice up there.\\n\\n Now the rocket engine is [still] really hot, because it has just finished its firing [from] landing on the Moon, and the heat is soaking back up into that liquid. The liquid not only expands when it gets hot, but particularly in the case of the fuel, if it gets real hot, it can spontaneously decompose and blow up. So they were quite worried on the very first flight, Apollo 11; when they saw this temperature and pressure in this short section of line rising, rising, rising, and they were perhaps even worried that that pressure and temperature might get so high that that section of line would explode. And if it were to explode, it would destroy [not only] the LM descent stage, but also the ascent stage on top. So the astronauts even had to wait inside the ascent stage for this pressure/temperature problem to be resolved in case it started getting out of hand. They were prepared to have to blast off before even getting out of the LM.\\n\\n So luckily, in that case, one of the valves relieved it. The backpressure was high enough or maybe the ice block was not a total solid ice block, and the pressure bled through and reduced. But for the next missions, they built a tiny little eighth-inch-diameter bypass line around the heat exchanger, which would not affect the total [fuel] flow during operational conditions, but would let the pressure bleed back [if the heat exchanger froze]. So we had to test those little things here after a flight.\\n\\n On an individual level, I was thrilled to death to be asked to go down and work in the spacecraft analysis room during the actual flights of Apollo 10 and 15. The SPAN [Spacecraft Analysis] Room is right adjacent to Mission Control, and their role is to monitor continuously everything that’s going on in [every system on the vehicles, including] your particular system of expertise. So [in my case], that was all three LM propulsion systems.\\n\\n Those particular days, I think, are still some of the most exciting of my whole career. You got to participate in the moment-to-moment events of a flight. You’re right on the circuit, listening to all the conversations between the astronauts and the grounds. No, we didn’t get to talk to the astronauts directly, but it was still cool watching everything that was going on, all the unexpected little glitches, all the frantic conversations, the little workarounds, maybe helping some of the other groups besides propulsion, like guidance or navigation or the life support system, help them thrash out some of their problems, especially if it involved a propulsion maneuver or something like that.\\n\\n Although we didn’t get to speak directly with the astronauts, we were listening in on their minute-to-minute conversations as they proceeded through their flight plan. The flight plan is a book that’s about the size of a Sears catalog, and it is a timeline that shows exactly what every one of the three crewmen is supposed to be doing every minute of the entire flight [from launch through splashdown]! So there [were] three columns on the page, [one] for the commander, [one for] the LM pilot, and [one for] the command module pilot, exactly what they’re supposed to be doing [at any time]. One guy’s supposed to be eating. Another guy is supposed to be doing some experiment. Another guy is supposed to be putting on a suit or something like that.\\n\\n So you were right in the thick of things the whole time. [And] it was really exciting to be part of the succession of all these little mini crises and little mini celebrations each time a significant milestone was passed throughout the whole duration of the flight, from liftoff to splashdown – [nearly a whole week or so]. Those were some long days and long nights, because things don’t happen just on a regular eight-to-five schedule in space. They’re doing things at all hours of the night or day. So that was way cool back then, especially for a twenty-five-year-old guy."

And the mission had begun a couple of days earlier with the liftoff, so, of course, [at work] we were watching all the procedures and things that were going on. But by then, the White Sands job was really over, and so White Sands did not have a real active role in the mission. So from here on, it was just me as a personal spectator, like all of the other millions of people throughout the world. So the night that Apollo 11 landed, I got my son and my wife up early, and went over to the in-laws’ house. They had a better TV than we did. So my little four-year-old kid was there snoozing while we watched the first steps on the Moon.\\n\\n People that didn’t know a whole lot about it, they were all just really excited. I was a mixture of excited, and I was awestruck. In fact, the hair is still up on my arms right now [nearly 34 years later (gestures)], even remembering it, because I knew of [some of] the problems that we still had, and those guys were [ready to fire the LM descent engine]—I kept thinking, “[Wait], we haven’t totally resolved this 400-cycle pressure oscillation in the LM descent engine, and that might be a real problem.” [And what about the dozens of other little unanswered questions the engineers all over the country still had?]”\\n\\n [But] those [astronaut] guys were, “Let’s go.” They’re going to fly it anyway. There’s all sorts of little things that the public didn’t know weren’t totally, totally resolved. We [knew we didn't have absolutely] everything worked out. But when those guys landed, I cried. I was so happy, I just cried. [Sort of like at a wedding, when you're actually real happy, but there are so many emotions going on and so much stress relief, that it just comes out in tears.]"

        "utterance": "Oh yes. In fact, I think that virtually all of the astronauts at one time or another came out to White Sands, and that means not only the Apollo-era astronauts, but specifically also the Shuttle-era astronauts. So, yes, that was kind of a fringe benefit. During Apollo days, the astronauts would come out just to watch [and] see how some of these rocket engines systems were working, because [it’s] the only time that they could ever see them in action until they actually got on the vehicle. Remember, these were one-time-shot engines, so you couldn’t just go fire them for demonstration.\\n\\n So, yes, we met many of the astronauts, even if it was just kind of in passing, or you would see them in a visiting party. Sometimes you actually got to talk with them. Sometimes if they were going to stay a whole day, they’d even have lunch with you. So, [yes], that was fun, even way back in Apollo.\\n\\n Now, when they started the Shuttle Program, they even had an astronaut indoctrination program that specifically takes the astronauts around to every one of the NASA Centers so that the astronauts understand what goes on at each of the support installations that are working on some aspect of their flight. The astronauts are expected to be very articulate, knowledgeable spokesmen of the whole program, so they need to understand what goes on not just at Johnson Space Center, but all the other Centers [as well], and that includes White Sands Test Facility.\\n\\n So kind of a neat part of my current job is I arrange with the Houston Astronaut Office for these visits of all the new AsCans, the astronaut candidates, the brand-new incoming astronauts. So, they bring them out to White Sands Test Facility along with all the other NASA Centers, and we take them around for usually two days. We spend a day taking them around to the engine test stands and the materials test areas and that kind of stuff, and then another day over at White Sands Space Harbor [White Sands Missile Range], where they train how to land the Space Shuttle.\\n\\n So, yes, you get to go [to] dinner with them and kick around one day and then have a lunch with them and give them briefings and that kind of stuff, so they understand what’s going on out here. So, yes, I’ve met lots of the astronauts and got all kinds of autographs and things like that. So, yes, that’s kind of a fringe benefit.\\n\\n The neat part of that is that it humanizes the individuals. You get to recognize them as, jeez, if they didn’t have that blue suit on, you would just think that, hey, now, that’s a sharp fellow; or, my golly, she looks like she ought to be a tennis star or something like that, and she’s a Ph.D. mission specialist or something like that.\\n\\n They are regular people, but they are more than regular people. I’m particularly impressed with how well-rounded the astronauts end up by the time they actually fly. They know those systems so well, and they have so many systems to understand. I mean, they have to understand not just the rocket engine systems, but all the way through all the electrical and guidance and life control systems, [and so on]. And, boy, they know how all of that stuff works. I’ve spent a lifetime just trying to be good and learn stuff about one system, and those guys have mastered almost all of them. So they’re really pretty special."

        "utterance": "Well, remember, in 1968, that was still real peak times for the Apollo Program. In ’68, we flew the first mission to the Moon, Apollo 8, in December of ’68. So, yes, there [were] lots of activities still going on there. So when the word came out that, okay, there’s going to be a phase-down, well, jeez, everybody kind of knew that from the very beginning. We had known from the very start that, hey, this was not going to last forever. The whole base was built on the assumption that they would abandon it at the end of the Apollo Program. As soon as they landed on the Moon, our job was basically pretty much done. Our job was to prove that we could get there. And so by the time they got there, our job was done, and we were ready to move on. So, I don’t think it really bothered people a whole lot. We were pretty much unconcerned. We were busy around the clock, and besides, “That phase-down [is] in two years, don’t bother me with that now. I’ve got work to do for the next two years, and we’ll worry about that later.” So, yes, [the ’68]—the beginnings of the phase-down didn’t bother people very much.\\n\\n However, another couple of years later, when the General Smart committee came around with some actual structured means of phasing programs out, stopping work, sending people, transferring people off, it was actually going to involve layoffs, well, boy, that [became] a different story. By that time, our role was coming to a close. We’d already proven that they could do the Moon landings. So as soon as Neil [A.] Armstrong set foot on the Moon, we knew that our job was done and our days were numbered out there. We’d been having so much fun, and we did what we thought was a really good job on it, and nobody really wanted it to end, but that was happening. Some people took it really well. Others took it pretty hard. I know two guys that committed suicide. So, yes, it was a stressful time\\n\\n When the reality really finally hit that, hey, my job is over and, hey, the program is over, and it was clear by then that there wasn’t going to be anything else, we’d been going along thinking, “Okay, well, we’re going to go to the Moon, and then we’re going to build this big Nova booster, and then we’re going to Mars, and things are just going to be a progression.” So when the reality sunk in that, jeez, they cut off the last three missions, and, no, we’re not even going to fly those last three missions after all, and the public had kind of waned in their enthusiasm, and Congress had waned in their enthusiasm, and the money was drying up and ugh-oh, there isn’t going to be any more, well, then that’s when things got a little bit more depressing.\\n\\n So, the place went from a population of 1,800 in 1966, down to 200 people. There was nothing but a skeleton crew. It was a ghost town. No real work there; just a maintenance and management crew to keep it operational. [It was] just one step away from mothballs. So a lot of people got transferred, but a surprising number of people decided that they liked it so much here that they’d rather just get laid off here than return to their former workplace.\\n\\n The most notable of that was all the Grummanites [employees of Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation], the guys working on the lunar module that had, back in 1964, they had complained so much about having to go out to the boondocks out here, that they demanded, and got, salary concessions and all these special bonus programs. They called it the “10-40” program. They got a 10 percent salary increase and a guaranteed 40 hours per month of OT [overtime], if they could handle it. So, that was a big incentive for them to come out here. It was sort of like hazardous pay, as if coming out here was [hazardous] duty or something.\\n\\n So, they had come here. Many of them knew that they were going to be out here for five or six years, so they sold their houses back in high-dollar New York, and came out here with a salary raise. So, boy, all of a sudden, they had money. They had enough money to get the nicest places in town. They drove the best cars, because they made more money than anybody else around here. So they lived the high life for those five or six years. But now that it was time to go home, they found that, “Well, jeez, this boondocks isn’t quite so bad as I had thought. As a matter of fact, I kind of actually like it here.”\\n\\n So the same guys that back in 1964, when they [were told], “You’re going out to White Sands,” they said, “Hell, no, we won’t go,” now they [were told], “Okay. You’re going to go back to Bethpage [New York],” and [once again] they [said], “Hell, no, we won’t go.” [Laughs] So they decided, “Okay, I’ll just get laid off here, and fine.”\\n\\n So it was really pretty cool. They [said], “Go ahead. Lay me off.” They took unemployment. Here they took other odd jobs around town waiting for the next upturn in the aerospace business. That worked out really lucky for us that they had done that, because within the next few years or so, the Shuttle Program had been approved. We didn’t know whether that really was going to get approved. It wasn’t the go-to-Mars program that people thought, but, hey, it was better than nothing. So we were gearing back up again, and these people came back from their odd jobs and actually formed [the] core of our post-Apollo workforce out there. So we really depended upon their experience, and that’s what enabled us to really hit the ground running with Shuttle testing, depending upon those people that decided to stick it out here."

So, since I was at the worker level, hey, that worked fine for me. The guys out at the test stands, they were co-workers and they were good buddies, and we’d go drinking or have parties afterwards together, and let the managers cuss and fight each other. The upper-level management guys, let them go ahead and fight it out.\\n\\n We would hear about some pretty legendary confrontations, [you know, some of it] downright ugly. But people would come back to work the next day, and people didn’t carry grudges, well, at least most of them didn’t. I think things are a lot calmer these days. Individual personalities are not so much of a factor anymore. That may be because nobody is getting pushed as hard. We’re no longer working to a national mandate. We’re not working to a real tight schedule or anything like that. In a way, things are much more professional these days, but sometimes almost a bit bland, not that I welcomed some of the big hassles and fights and yelling and screaming at each other and all that kind of stuff, but things got done real well, and it was exciting and stimulating. Today seems almost calm and boring by comparison.\\n\\n I worked with virtually every one of the vehicle and engine manufacturers or prime contractors that came out here in a succession of projects. The great part of it was that you got exposed to the brightest and best of their engineers’ touting and proving their product and working with us to develop it. So the participants [were] a roll call of the major aerospace companies, many of which don’t even exist anymore because there’s been a lot of consolidation in the aerospace industry, like Grumman and North American [Aviation Inc.] and Rockwell [International Corporation] and Douglas [Aircraft Company Inc.] and Boeing [Company] and Rocketdyne [Division of North American Aviation Inc.] and TRW [Inc.] and Aerojet [General Corporation, Marquardt [Corporation] and Bell [Aero Systems Company]. A lot of those names don’t even ring a bell with you anymore because they’ve all bought each other, and there’s only three or four major companies left anymore.\\n\\n There [were] also a lot of subcontractors, and those are names you never hear again either, like Zia [Corporation], or Ram, and L&M and Unique [phonetic], [and] things like that, all these subcontractors. So just that variety was a real good opportunity."

        "utterance": "Well, the main thing was that we knew that, well, yes, the Shuttle was going to need some new engines, but it was not going to be some of the cutting-edge engine technology like before. So, because of cost constraints, it was going to have to make do with engines that either already existed or [were] kind of follow-on things. So there was going to be a lot of engine testing to do, but money was real tight. So, we did lots of work to streamline our procedures so that it took less time, which means less money, so it took fewer people to do some of the work. I remember that, yes, budgets were tight, and that meant that we didn’t have as many people to go do as much work, [and] so I think workloads did increase.\\n\\n We spent a lot of time fine-tuning and revamping some of the physical facilities to make them easier to operate with the reduced number of people that we had. I know, for example, we spent a lot of time revamping the big steam generator, the altitude simulation system so it would be more reliable, less downtime, less maintenance. We also modified it so that it didn’t have to run at full power. That thing cost about, even back then, it cost over 1,000 dollars a minute to run it. But it was big and designed to accommodate the power of the Apollo LM engines. Well, the [RCS (Reaction Control System)] engines on the Space Shuttle were a little bit smaller, and so you didn’t have to run it necessarily at full power, but it took some design changes to enable us to run it at partial power so that you’re not using so much propellants, you know, wasting it. There’s no sense having a 400 horsepower engine if you can only go fifty miles an hour. So, we did a lot of modifications on our systems to make them more cost-effective and able to run with fewer people.\\n\\n The biggest change, though, was in the laboratories where, particularly because of the experiences during Apollo, they’re now required to do lots and lots of tests on compatibility and flammability and outgassing on virtually every item that ever went into the—particularly the crew cabin of the Orbiter. And that was in addition to development and limits-testing on all these new components that didn’t exist back during Apollo.\\n\\n The reusability aspect of the Shuttle was a big change in philosophy for us and required lots of testing. The things on Apollo were designed so that they would operate very reliably once. The things on Shuttle had to be designed so that they could be reused over and over and over again, and in many cases the only way you can test whether something will operate over and over again is to [just] do it. So, you run multiple repetitive tests or accelerated aging tests to see how things will behave. You’re trying to compress ten years’ worth of missions into less than a year’s worth of testing so that you can make some design changes now to enable a system or a component to still be working reliably ten years from now."

        "utterance": "Well, let’s see. By the 1970s, the Apollo Program was just about over. We did the very last Apollo support tests in about ’72. We did some work on Skylab, which [was] our first Space Station using leftover Apollo parts. And the main testing then was to qualify and demonstrate that those parts that had been planned for use on Apollo for only a day or two now could operate for months, and it turns out that most of the designs for the systems on Apollo had been so overdesigned and so conservative and so well done, that even though they were originally made to operate only for a couple of days, they worked quite well when pushed way beyond those limits.\\n\\n One of the shining examples of that was the little baby reaction control engines, and there were thirty-two of those on the spacecraft. There were sixteen on the lunar module and sixteen on the command and service module. And each engine had a combustion chamber about the size of a flashlight battery, about the size of your fist. They put [out] one hundred pounds of thrust, and they were used to position the spacecraft, the attitude control. They were made to fire in tiny, short little bursts; “bam, bam, bam, bam.” And a typical burst, typical firing pulse, was shorter than the blink of your eye. And yet the Skylab Program required those things to operate night and day, night and day, for as much as three months, instead of three [to ten] days like a typical Apollo mission.\\n\\n Then when the Space Shuttle came along, they modified the design a little bit, but it still was supposed to run in pulse mode, “burp, burp, burp” mode, and yet they found that as soon as we got into operations with the Space Station, now the Space Station periodically needs to be reboosted. There’s still a few molecules of air up there even at that higher altitude, so it drags the Space Station down, and the original system to reboost the Space Station is still not available, and so they have to use the Space Shuttle when it’s docked onto the Space Station, and use the engines on a Space Shuttle to lift the whole pair, the whole combination, back up to the higher altitude necessary. So now they have to use these small engines that were originally designed to fire only for short little durations, like I say, shorter than the blink of an eye, and in order to boost the Space Station up, they now have to run them continuously for an hour and a half, which is way beyond what any of the engineers had thought that thing would be required to do.\\n\\n So we’ve done a lot of testing to verify that, yes, these things can operate way beyond their design lifetime. Sometimes it took some design changes or materials changes to make them last that long, but yes, those were some of the things that we were doing even back in the early seventies.\\n\\n Then by mid-seventies, by like ’73 and ’74, we started getting into pure Shuttle work. Apollo and Skylab were over, and then we were moving on into Shuttle. The first work was the Shuttle [orbital] maneuvering engine selection, so they had a runoff between competing contractors and their different prototype designs, and that was pretty cool because you got to work with each of these competing manufacturers: Aerojet, Bell, TRW, and Rocketdyne. And they each brought their prototype engines out here, and we fired the things, and we used the performance evaluation program that I’d helped develop late in Apollo to evaluate those engines against a constant standard, so you could compare apples to apples and evaluate the performance of those engines, [eventually] leading to the selection of Aerojet to [build] that orbit maneuvering engine.\\n\\n After you select the production engine, then you go into development, which means, okay, you work out some bugs and then make some design changes, and then we demonstrate that the thing will actually do what it’s supposed to do. So there’s development while you make changes. Then you freeze the design, and then you put it through all the certification test requirements to demonstrate that it really will perform in space.\\n\\n There wasn’t always enough work to do in the propulsion area, so for a year or so I worked up in the laboratories, even. I worked on some experiments that were going aboard the Skylab, so that was interesting, but I still liked working on rocket engines the most.\\n\\n So, by ’76 or 1977, we’d already selected the OMS [Orbital Maneuvering System] engine manufacturer [Aerojet], but it turned out to be a very conservative design. They wanted to make real certain that this thing was going to last and last, but in order to be a conservative, very safe design, the thing didn’t extract all the last bit of horsepower out of the engine that they could have, and so one of the tradeoffs is between high performance and combustion stability. And so typically, engines that are very high performance may run on the ragged edge of this combustion instability, which can destroy an engine in half a second. So if there were a way to suppress some of this combustion instability, you might be able to get even more horsepower, more performance, called specific impulse, out of the engines.\\n\\n So another fellow from JSC and I worked on a year-long project developing some alternate means of damping these instabilities in rocket engines that without those suppression devices in there were spontaneously unstable and would destroy themselves in a second or so. And by so doing, we could increase the performance by 2 or 3 percent, which is a huge amount in the rocket engine business. Anyway, so that was kind of a pure research program that I got to work on for a while. Turns out that they decided not to adopt it. They [said], “Well, the performance is good enough as is, and we don’t need the extra complication of this suppression device. Besides, it sticks out a little bit too far around the side of the engine and we’re kind of cramped for space for that. So we’re just going to stick with the original design.”\\n\\n But, yes, that was a fun program to work on in the mid-seventies up into the 1980s."

        "utterance": "A year or two ago. Anyway, I worked for Rob Tillett as a test operations director, ended up working for him for twenty-six years. Anyway, he was a cool guy. I really enjoyed him— [he was really intelligent and knowledgeable about a really wide variety of subjects that I also was interested in, and we shared several hobbies, like dirt bikes, and guns, and astronomy and photography. He really taught me a lot about many of those things, as well as the technical aspects of doing my job.] Anyway, he was chief of propulsion test operations [for a dozen years], and then was selected as manager [in late 1981]. So, he asked me to come join him. He [said], “Do you want to come move up the hall with me?”\\n\\n [I didn't hesitate long, and said], “Well, okay.”\\n\\n He said, “I particularly need somebody who can write.”\\n\\n So I could tell, all right, well, I’m going to be getting out of the rocket engine test business, but by that point in time, the rocket engine world had gotten pretty, fairly mundane, I thought. We weren’t doing anything new. The Shuttle was already flying, so now we were just working on life-cycle-extension kind of things, and the rocket engine world wasn’t so appealing anymore, and besides, there was a promise of a promotion. “All right!” A little bit more money! Maybe not quite as much fun, but anyway, it was a new job.\\n\\n There hadn’t ever been a technical assistant to the manager, and he said, “Well, I’m just going to need a hand in a lot of technical areas [here].” So it really kind of combined the duties from a lot of other overloaded people around. So, it was like specifically I was supposed to be the technical manager of the support services contract. Now, the previous guy—we made a real distinction to call it the technical manager of the contract, because the previous guy had called himself \"technical manager.\" Well, that became a real ego sticking point, because the manager, rightfully, thought that he was the top dog there, and here’s this other underling, some GS [General Schedule]-14 there, calling himself \"technical manager.\" Anyway, that title was kind of abused, so, well, we made certain that I was called technical assistant to the manager.\\n\\n I also then became responsible for public affairs and security and legal office liaison, and technical editing, like I was supposed to review all technical publications out of our base for technical accuracy and correct usage and that sort of stuff.\\n\\n [After a dozen years, and thinking I was on the verge of retiring], I eventually dropped the technical manager aspect in 1998 with the advent of a whole new [performance-based] contracting type out here. [This] was a whole new [kind of] contract, and we were no longer a level of effort kind of a contract. [I thought] it was [just] a politically-driven change in the overall format of the contract, [and I wasn't real convinced that it was the best way to do it, but had no choice but to go along]. So I was pleased to move [out of that and] on to something else. However, there was a whole new set of responsibilities coming along in the world of export control, which basically [aims] to protect NASA knowledge and technology from uncontrolled proliferation and usage by people that shouldn’t be using our information that way, mainly to help protect and maintain America’s competitive edge in technologies. [So I took on that responsibility.]\\n\\n I ended up writing lots and lots of policy documents and position papers and did a lot of strategic planning kind of work to position NASA in the marketplace, in addition to editing all of these technical publications primarily out of the laboratories and things like that. I’d have to do all the periodic reports summarizing our activities for higher-ups. In particular, it seemed like there were almost yearly attacks by [NASA] Headquarters [Washington, D.C.], almost always by somebody out of Headquarters [that] had never been out to White Sands Test Facility, didn’t know really what we do, but they see us as a forty-million-dollar-a-year budget line out there and says, “Hey, we’re in [a] hurt for money, so let’s get rid of these guys.”\\n\\n So there’d be a committee formed, and [there’d] be some people from Headquarters to come out here to see. “Okay. Well, show us why we can’t get along without you,” or, “Show us what we’re going to lose, because we’re going to plan to close the base.”\\n\\n So this became almost a recurring event. So I’d be part of the team, usually the main one to compile all the papers, the position papers, or impact statements, they were usually called, typically [a hundred] pages long or something like that, to show to these guys. We called them boarding parties, because we considered them pirates. They [were] going to try to take us over or put us out of business. So those were major recurring jobs as technical assistant."

        "utterance": "Yes, sure. Again, like the Apollo fire, once the shock and the personal tragedy was absorbed, we got down to business and did a lot of tests on some of the redesigned components. Particularly the laboratories did lots of tests to determine [in] even better detail the safety and flammability of different materials and components used throughout the Orbiter. Up in the propulsion world, we tested some of the alternate escape mechanisms, which in some cases, in one case, even involved having the astronauts attach themselves to like a bazooka rocket, and the rocket, they’d attach a lanyard onto this rocket and fire the rocket and [it] would jerk them out of the side of the Orbiter. So, “Okay, [well], we’ll test that if you think it’s a really good idea.” [Laughs] It turns out that, yes, the engines would work, but the probability of being able to really use that as an escape mechanism was really pretty low.\\n\\n Our guys did some of the video analysis of the explosion of the\\n\\n Challenger\\n\\n to see exactly—they wanted to back into a prediction of how big that explosion really was, how powerful it was, how much of the propellants had reacted. Of course, to people on the ground, it looked like a huge explosion in the air, but most of what we saw was really just condensation and vaporization of those ultra cold cryogenic propellants. If that much oxygen and hydrogen had really fully reacted, it would’ve looked like an A-bomb up there. It would’ve been much, much bigger than that.\\n\\n So one of the things that NASA really needed to know for any of the upcoming missions is, okay, well, how bad would an explosion be if you mixed these propellants together? In particular, we had some missions coming up going to Jupiter, Galileo, and then some of the other deep-space missions like Cassini [going to Saturn]. Now, those missions use radioactive power generator sources, and those RTGs, they’re called, radioisotope thermal generators, it’s necessary because once you get far away from the sun, you no longer can use solar panels to create energy, and batteries don’t work [long enough], and so these things create [electrical] energy by [using the thermal energy of] radioactive decay. But you want to protect that plutonium source in there so that in the event of a rocket explosion, you’re not scattering plutonium all up and down the eastern seaboard and poisoning millions of people.\\n\\n So the RTGs are encased in a very heavy protective casing. But we wanted to make certain that, okay, well, if the Shuttle were to explode, would that explosion breach the protective shell on it? So since you can’t really simulate the full explosion of a Shuttle, we did some subscale tests mixing oxygen, liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen together to determine how big an explosion would be.\\n\\n We even ended up building a special test facility or high-energy blast facility to do fairly large-scale tests up to a ton of rocket fuel and oxidizer together exploding to see, [okay, well], how big would the explosion be? And some very important conclusions were reached by those programs. In particular, there is an equation called the quantity-distance relation. It means how much quantity of propellant can you have, and if it were to react, how far away do you need to have structures and people so that they don’t suffer damage. And the Department of Defense for many years had used an assumption that if you had liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen and they were to mix together and blow up, you would get an explosion equal to about 60 percent as much as the same amount of TNT. So it’s called a TNT equivalency of 60 percent. So that meant that, boy, you would have a mighty big explosion if you had half a million gallons of TNT go off.\\n\\n It turns out that our several years’ worth of experiments, after\\n\\n Challenger\\n\\n , showed that that number was way too high, and so instead of 60 percent, the real number turned out to be somewhere between about 8 and 16 percent. So that meant that the fuel and oxidizer did not really react very well together, and so they did not make an as big an explosion as the Department of Defense had been assuming. Actually, what happens is as soon as the first layer of fuel and oxidizer get together, yes, they react and they explode, but they blow away the rest of the reactants. So it doesn’t always get a chance to mix and actually blow up after all.\\n\\n So the military was very interested in that. For example, Vandenberg Air Force Base [California]. Vandenberg was originally proposed as the western launching place for the Space Shuttles. And you notice, jeez, you never hear about Vandenberg anymore. Well, Vandenberg is on a very small spit of land, and the launch control center is necessarily pretty darn close to the launch pad. Not only that, but in order to get the exhaust gases out from underneath the Shuttle, they made like a little underground tunnel to deflect the exhaust gas out, and you might even see some indications of that down at the Cape. The exhaust goes out kind of sideways.\\n\\n Well, in the case of Vandenberg, because of the geometry and the geography of the launch pad, that was into a great big, large-diameter tunnel. It’s okay as long as exhaust gas is going through there, but somebody posed the question, what would happen if you had what was called a pad abort, and you start up the SSMEs, the [Space Shuttle] Main Engines, and something is not happening right with them, and you have to shut them down, even before you light off the solid rocket boosters. In that case, when they shut down, they dump about 400 pounds of excess pure hydrogen out. That’s the amount that’s still trapped in the engine, and it all goes out, and now there’s all this hydrogen contained in this tunnel which is open to the atmosphere, and a single spark could set off that hydrogen in there.\\n\\n So some of our tests indicated that it was quite conceivable that the ignition of that trapped hydrogen in the exhaust duct at Vandenberg would literally blow the Shuttle right off of the pad. So, as a result, Vandenberg was scrapped as a Shuttle launch facility, so they will never consider launching a Shuttle from Vandenberg. So that’s why you never heard about Vandenberg ever again. So that was some of our work done out there in the post-\\n\\n Challenger\\n\\n era."

        "utterance": "Yes, inspection days was the JSC Center Director’s idea of how to acquaint not just the general public, but the rest of the industrial complexes with what the Johnson Space Center not only did, but also perhaps could do for them, looking for maybe some spinoffs and ways that aerospace technology down at JSC could be used in some of the commercial businesses.\\n\\n So every year for, I think beginning in 1996, they would open up the Johnson Space Center and have exhibits showing off some of their new technology and capabilities both in machining and software electronics and things like that. And they’d invite industry leaders from all over the country, but primarily from the Houston region, to come in there and see “what do you do and what perhaps could we do together?”\\n\\n And so White Sands was invited to bring exhibits just to show what we did out there. So I was responsible for putting together the team and all of the exhibits and training the staffers to go down there for the three-day event every year, to tell the White Sands Test Facility story to those people; even though everyone recognized from the beginning that there’s not very much that this rocket engine test facility 800 miles away can do for these industry people down there in Houston, but at least it was an opportunity for us to tell our story.\\n\\n It turned out that even though I don’t think it was of very much value to the industrial people that were invited to come see it, it was a great opportunity for the people at Johnson Space Center itself to see what their buddies in the boondocks were doing, because most of them have no experience with us whatsoever. They see that White Sands Test Facility organizationally shows up as a little line under Johnson Space Center, but most of them don’t really know what we do. And so since we were right there on campus, it was a good chance for them to go by and say, “Oh, [yeah], hey, we’ve heard of you guys. Oh, neat place you got out there. Jeez, yes, you do some cool stuff.” So, it gave a better appreciation for the general populace down there at Houston into what we were doing."

        "utterance": "Well, I knew you were going to ask me that, and I thought about it for a long time, and it’s difficult to think about, okay, what does she mean by a challenge? Does that mean something that was the most difficult to do for me? Yes, maybe so, in which case I think that probably my biggest challenge was the recurring requirement for constantly evaluating the support contractors’ performance on [both] a macro and a micro level. That was the technical measure of the contract aspect. Jeez, I did that for twenty years. And that involved creating and implementing and constantly evolving these fee-bearing evaluations into a fair and timely management tool to incentivize and reward the contractor for doing the job that they were supposed to do.\\n\\n The reason I consider it a challenge was because, first of all, it wasn’t something that I trained for. I didn’t go to school to be a contract manager, so it was a little bit out of my original focus. The other thing is, the process just always seemed kind of pressured and contentious among all the different multiple NASA participants. They were all senior to me, and they all had their own diverse and divergent opinions and agendas and priorities for evaluating how the contractor was doing their job. And this was a part of our job, to manage the contractor, and you gave them money based upon how well you graded their jobs, graded their performance on doing the job.\\n\\n I thought it was a painful process, and it consumed nearly a third of my total hours as technical manager, and so every six months, in addition to bimonthly meetings that consumed two solid days of listening to people griping about how the contractor had done, which put me in a position of passing judgment on my [contractor] peers, and I was not always real comfortable with that, but, yes, it’s a necessary part of the job, and you start separating the people from their performance, and that was the important part. You just look at the performance and not bring the people into it.\\n\\n So that was every two months, and then every six months we had to write up this sixty- or seventy-page document that detailed all of this performance evaluation. Then an oral presentation to the committee and the JSC Director, and George [W. S.] Abbey was particularly good at grilling and questioning nearly every conclusion and grading criterion and rationale.\\n\\n [Then] there evolved a mentality that \"if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it,\" which I suppose has some merit. The idea behind all that was to take some of the subjectivity out of the contract management and evaluation process and turn it into measurable milestones and things that you can say, “Okay, well, you took this test and you got an 80 on it,” not just someone saying, “Yes, I think you did pretty darn good, and I’m going to give you an 80 percent grade on it,” because then they’d come back and say, “Well, gee, why don’t I get a 90?” Or the other side would say, “Well, jeez, we expect you to be competent, and so if you do the things that we tell you to, hey, that should be average. So you should only get a 60 or a 70 for that.”\\n\\n And then the contractor would say, “My golly, do I have to walk on water to get a 90?” And I’d say, “Well, [yeah], and if you can walk on water without getting your feet wet, well, then, we’ll give you a 95.” They’d say, “Well, gee, what do I have to do to get a 98?”\\n\\n So there was a lot of philosophizing and constant adjustments going on, so there’s a constant challenge, and although I eventually came to dread the process every six months, I’m proud that these evaluations were often held up as a model for others to follow at JSC. George would finally, after he finished grilling us, would say, “Okay, guys. Well, I agree. You’re doing a darn good job, and I wish most of our guys were doing as well on it, too.” That was really pretty—in a way I would consider that probably the most challenging aspect because it was repeated for so long.\\n\\n As far as significant accomplishments, it’s hard to say. I’m not even real sure that anything that I ever did was really significant, certainly not in terms of the overall space program, certainly no breakthroughs or advancements for the program. Maybe even just barely perceptible even on a local level. People have short memories. There’s a lot of turnover, and most of all, the culture is not one that individuals do spectacular, recognizable things. Most things are done by teams or committees or something like that. So, you just notice it. [“Okay], well, hey, something finally got done. Hey, that’s good.” And nobody ever asks, “Well, who invented that?” It’s not important for somebody to stand up and say, “Hey, I did that. Give me a star,” or something.\\n\\n For example, [even though] I bet that none of today’s propulsion engineers at White Sands even know [it]—and it doesn’t matter to me—I was primarily responsible for creating in the late sixties and early seventies the first rocket engine performance analysis, and the standard correction program, which became the core of all those performance analysis programs used since then. Now, I didn’t do it all by myself. I took some ideas from some of the experts that I had met from Rocketdyne and Aerojet, and put some of their ideas and applied them directly to our needs out here, [and it] become a really useful tool not only for my own data analysis and test report prep [preparation], but for all the rest of the guys that followed me, even though I was the main driver, but I’m not a programmer, so I didn’t invent the whole thing myself. It takes lots of other people to do it.\\n\\n Another thing that I’m pretty pleased with is our website. And again, I’m not a real computer guy, but I was the one that sat down with the computer wizard for nearly a year to come up with the content and presentation for our first website in ’96. Now again, I took lots of ideas from the other organizations as propulsion and engineering in the laboratories and all that kind of stuff, to get these ideas and put them into a new kind of format. That was only six or seven years ago, and people no longer even associate me with the website. I’ve moved on. My name no longer appears as the responsible NASA person on there. We’ve reorganized, and now that person who is the responsible guy, he isn’t responsible for the content. He’s just responsible for like the HTML coding on it or something like that. But the first website was really an outgrowth of my responsibilities as public affairs, where I had to keep making these capabilities brochures that were used for marketing as part of [our] strategic planning. You were supposed to be able to send out these capabilities brochures so that people would say, “Oh, wow, you guys can do cool stuff. I think I’ll bring my business and my money here.”\\n\\n Well, things got so they were evolving so quickly, that a paper-based brochure could hardly keep up with the changes in technology and our rapidly evolving capabilities. Production costs for paper were real high, [and] when the website stuff came along, my boss really kind of forced me into it. He said, “I think we need to develop a website.” So, yes, I was the primary one to do that, [but like I said, I had plenty of help].\\n\\n I’m also quite pleased [that] I’ve had the opportunity to really enhance our facility’s security posture with a really well-disciplined, well-equipped, and well-trained staff. We got the latest, greatest state-of-the-art equipment to ensure the safety and security of the people and the property and the assets out there. And again, the people from Houston who come up here out to our base and visit often remark that, jeez, they wish their security force down there was operated as well as it did out here.\\n\\n And even though it may not have really been significant, I’d still have to say that the times I was able to actively participate in real missions like Apollo 10 and 15 or during one of our tests to be able to catch a runaway rocket engine problem, maybe just a few seconds before it destroyed itself, or just to be on the team that found and fixed a problem that was a real stumbling block to certifying an engine or a system, those are fleeting moments that I’ll really remember. Not famous. Nobody remembers who did it, but, boy, I was pleased to be in on those things. That was enough for me."

And if you had anything done that required math work, you had the mechanical calculators. You would have to write up a special work order to have anything done on a computer. Secretaries did all of the actual writing, to turn things into final form. So certainly within the last ten years, the computerization has made just a huge difference out there.\\n\\n We used to kind of brute-force things, all the spreadsheets and management tools—in a way they’ve actually increased rather than decreased the [individual] workload, because [of] the things that we used to segregate out—for example, project engineers never used to have to worry about budget. No, that was an entire organization that worked about the budgets. Now the project engineers, they have to do all that stuff themselves. They also had a scheduling department; the scheduling people took care of that. Now the project engineers have to do that. Well, they’re doing it largely with canned programs, you know, [like] Microsoft Project Manager. You plug those things in, and it does all the scheduling and resource allocation, the manpower and the money and the cost-tracking codes and things like that, that never before were consolidated all into a single individual. So there’s a lot of responsibility on a single guy.\\n\\n In addition to the human resources aspect of supervising your people, [you’ve] got to do the technical and [the] budget and scheduling and all that sort of stuff. These are [tasks] that ordinarily would’ve been broken down into at least two or three separate jobs.

We’d be poring over these charts and the data printouts to come to a kind of a consensus about what this little squiggle here meant or whatever.\\n\\n I know some of the early data would come out not only in number form, just numerical, during this half-second time slice a chamber pressure read so many pounds per square inch, and the injector temperature was this much, not only in digital data, but there was [also] a lot of analog stuff back then, so it would be a chart really either with ink on a piece of paper, or we had some high-speed stuff called oscillographs, and that was where a moving beam of light would write upon a rapidly moving piece of photosensitive paper, and that paper could move at up to 156 inches per second. So that allows you to spread one second out into thirteen feet.\\n\\n So, during a test, when you had to watch something that was going to be over with in a quarter-second, you would choreograph the guy running the machine. Then he’d press the button a second early to give the machine time to get up to speed, and it would spit and spew paper halfway across the room, and you’d end up with 150 feet of data, and you had something that was over within ten seconds. Then you’d go back and you’d look for this little spike in pressure there. At that speed, an eye blink is three feet long. So you could see all the little fluttering in the muscles in the eyelid or whatever. You could watch all the pressure oscillations in a feed line during a start transient as the rocket fuels begin to combust and then go into final steady-state combustion.\\n\\n They used some special tools called a Gerber scale to measure out and scale, okay, well, if the peak is four inches on here, well, how many pounds per square inch is that? So you’d measure it off. Okay, well, if four inches is a hundred pounds per square inch, and this little spike here is three inches, well, that means that it’s seventy-five pounds per square inch. So you’d measure the little squiggles with [the] special [Gerber] ruler. And then you’d kick it around and decide what that really meant and then write your report based on that.\\n\\n But, no, there wasn’t a team of mathematicians or anybody like that, that I knew of to call on, probably because that part of it wasn’t necessary."

Of course, they didn’t want their basement blown up or their house burned down either, so they had some very valid reasons for emphasizing the safety on it. But they both grudgingly finally accepted that I really wanted to do this, [and] was actually doing things as safe as I knew how within the limitations of a teenage boy that wants to go do some of these kind of off-the-wall things. Safety certainly was not my big, overriding concern.

There was never any pressure to do anything in particular, to be anything, although there was a big emphasis, “Yes, we really think you ought to go to college.” I mean, that was just a given from day one. It was portrayed in pretty easy-to-understand terms, \"Hey, you go to school, yes, you suffer going to school, but, you end up with a better job, one that you like a little better, one that doesn’t require you to be out digging a ditch when you’re sixty years old, something that may end up paying you a little better, maybe a little better way of life, and especially something that can hold your interest and really be satisfying for you years and years later.\"\\n\\n So, yes, just that general orientation worked out real well, and I really—I had my dream job. I had the rare opportunity to start my career at the top. I mean, this is really what I [always] wanted to do, and I lucked into it, but it was just an all-time high to be able to be on the team that was going to the Moon. I mean, this was something that mankind had dreamed about doing for thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years, and by golly, we were the ones that got to do it. So that was pretty amazing."

        "utterance": "I was thinking before I came in for the interview. I can’t remember everything. I keep notes, and since we’ve gotten in the digital age my notes in my notebook aren’t quite as copious as they used to be. Back at home I’ve got stenographer notebooks and three-ring five-by-eight notebooks that I’ve saved over the years that chronicle everything when I was chief of the office and all the issues that were going on. I think it’d be nice if I would have sat down and paged through some of that stuff, just to bring back memories on it all. It’s amazing how much has transpired in the last 30 years since I’ve been at NASA. That’s hard to believe too; 1985 to 2015, it seems like it’s gone by in the blink of an eye sometimes.\\n\\n STS-65 was my first command. It was on Columbia. It was a Spacelab mission. It was International Microgravity Lab [IML]-2. It was a great crew. Jim [James D.] Halsell was my pilot. It was Jim’s first flight. Carl [E.] Walz was MS [Mission Specialist]-2 and flight engineer. Rick [Richard J.] Hieb was the payload commander. Rick was one of my classmates in our astronaut class in 1985. Had Leroy Chiao and Don [Donald A.] Thomas. It was their first flight, and Chiaki Mukai was payload specialist. Chiaki, of course, was the first Japanese female to fly in space.\\n\\n It was really a good time. We had a Spacelab in the payload bay. We had 83 experiments from around the world. It was a model for how science was done on the International Space Station. We were working with the folks up at Huntsville [Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama], out of the Payload Ops Center up there, as well as folks overseas. We trained all over. We went to Japan. It was very much the model the International Space Station uses. I got to do a couple of experiments back in the laboratory. Things I remember—just anecdotal stories.\\n\\n We had a red shift and a blue shift, because we worked 24 hours a day, 12 on, 12 off, doing the science. I was in charge of the red shift, and Carl Walz was in charge of the blue shift. The tools that we have now are much better, but back then we had the Hi8 video cameras. I’d take the day’s events that we’d recorded all day, and during my off time I’d condense it, edit it, and make a really nice flow of the day on everything that we did and dump it down to MCC [Mission Control Center] with a narration that they could easily put on NASA TV. It was very time-consuming. One night I remember Carl said, “Are you ever going to go to sleep so I can be in charge?”\\n\\n We had sleep compartments down on the middeck instead of sleeping in sleeping bags, so that you could still be down on the middeck making food. There were four of them on the wall on the starboard side of the middeck. They were really nice. One of the advantages of being the commander was I had my own, whereas the other three had to hot-bunk and share. So they had to set up their sleeping bags every night and roll them up in the morning to make room for the other crew [member] that was working, whereas mine was mine all the time. It was nice.\\n\\n There’s another interesting story too. It was fun. One of the experiments –Chiaki Mukai was doing this lower body negative pressure (LBNP) [experiment]. It’s a suit that you climbed into, a tube that wrapped around your waist, then it would suck on you essentially. It was like drawing a vacuum in it, to pull all the fluid down into your lower extremities, to simulate being on Earth again. They were looking at how it impacted the heart. We were back in the lab; Chiaki was in the LBNP. They didn’t want us to be doing the experiment when they didn’t have contact with the ground so that they could monitor Chiaki and make sure that she didn’t have a heart arrhythmia.\\n\\n We came into a zone of exclusion. It was back when we had TDRS [Tracking and Data Relay Satellite] East, and TDRS West and we didn’t have full coverage all the way around. I can’t remember exactly where, the Indian Ocean somewhere. You had this zone where you had no communication with the ground, so they asked us to stop and wait till we got on the other side. It was one of the longer ones.\\n\\n I didn’t have anything to do at the time, so I decided to entertain Chiaki and Rick. They didn’t see me. On the end cone of the lab we had this large IML flag mounted on the end of it. When they were looking I went down there, took it off the wall, and tied it around my neck like a cape like Superman. I pushed off the end of the end cone and went flying over Chiaki with my arm out like Superman flying by. I said, “IML man.” I was going back and forth, having a ball, and they were laughing. We’re almost out of this [zone of exclusion], so I went and put it all back. The folks called up from Marshall. The recorders were still running with the cameras, and they said, “We can downlink.” I said, “No, that’s okay. There’s nothing to downlink; we weren’t doing anything.” Somewhere in the archives of STS-65, nobody’s found it yet or went looking for it, but there’s IML man flying around in the Spacelab.\\n\\n It was a lot of work. We spent a lot of time. Being in space was fun too. We’re still normal people up there. The mission just went extremely well. At the time we set the record for the longest Shuttle mission. We had the EDO pallet, Extended Duration Orbiter pallet, on board. At the time we were flying the Extended Duration Orbiter Waste Management System, which was different from the regular toilet on the Shuttle. It’s much like the toilet that’s on the Space Station. Anyway, we set the record, but it got broken; records are made to be broken.\\n\\n I’ll never forget coming in to land. My first flight, I really felt gravity when I got back, just felt heavy. The second flight was better. The third flight I was thinking, “Oh gosh, you’ve got to land the Space Shuttle, I wonder how I’m going to feel.” I had so much adrenaline going, I couldn’t even feel gravity. We had a detailed test objective. That was interesting.\\n\\n Here it’s July 1994, and we’re still doing test objectives to better understand the Orbiter’s aerodynamics. At the approach and land transition, I did a roll doublet and a rudder doublet. It’s essentially a displacement of the vehicle in roll, a set amount at a set rate in each direction, and the same thing in yaw. Then they can back out from that the actual aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle at that point. The other day I was looking at a videotape of that approach and land transition. I said, “Okay, stand by for the maneuver.” You see everybody’s heads in the vehicle going back and forth as I did the roll and rudder doublet. Then nailed the landing. That felt really good. I just remember getting off the vehicle. I didn’t want to give it up. I was sitting in the seat, and finally the commander has to get out.\\n\\n Phil Stepaniak was our flight surgeon. He was always over at the gym. I got out of the seat and we were in the passageway between the crew vehicle and the middeck. I looked up and I said, “Phil, you want to wrestle?” He said, “No, I can see it in your eyes.” Those were fun stories.\\n\\n It was a great flight. We didn’t land on the first revolution or first day. Weather was bad. We had to go around and came back and landed on Runway 33 at KSC [Kennedy Space Center, Florida] the next day. I remember after we got the payload bay doors back open and out of our suits, I was just really tired. I just curled up on the floor of the flight deck back in the corner, underneath where the controls are for the arm, and took a nap.\\n\\n Chiaki, I love her to death; after 15 days in space it was still like her first day. She’s just bouncing [off the walls]. She never learned how to move with finesse. She banged into me and woke me up, and she didn’t even know it. That’s another story. We were in Japan afterwards for the postflight. She’s a national hero. Japanese are very proper, and she always deferred to me as the commander. I embarrassed her a little bit. “Mukai-san.” I’m following her. Good person. That was a great crew.\\n\\n Leroy and Don, just great guys. They really enjoyed their first flight and went on to bigger and better things. It all worked out very well."

Our mission on the first flight was to deploy Ulysses. It was over Columbus Day weekend. I remember we went to the Cape [Canaveral, Florida] for the launch, flew our mission, and five days later we were home. It was like being gone for a long weekend. It was like, “Were we really in space?” It just went by really fast.\\n\\n The DoD mission was a little bit longer. We had some science that we did while we were up there in addition to deploying DoD-1. The Spacelab mission was long. Again, that was a lot of science. The Space Station assembly mission was just a lot more complex. Everything had to go right. It was a sequence of events between the three EVAs [Extravehicular Activities], all the assembly, the checkout. I can’t even remember. I don’t think we even flew any other experiments on board. There were probably some, but all I remember is the assembly and all we had to do. I don’t think there was anything else.\\n\\n The first flight, I was in charge of the rats that flew. We had an animal enclosure facility, and I had to make sure they were doing okay every day. That was interesting. Second flight, we did some fluids experiments. We did fire in space; that was cool, looking at how flames propagate. Going back to the first flight, we did a “Space Basics” video. Bill [William M.] Shepherd was our director. This was part of his idea from the very beginning, an educational video on what is microgravity, how do you get to space, why are you weightless. He storyboarded the whole thing ahead of time. We shot some of the stuff here on Earth before and after the flight, and then we had sequences that we shot on orbit. My favorite words from Shep—we didn’t have that much free time, but when we did we were working on this “Space Basics” video. We’d shoot a scene, and Shep would say, “That was really good, but.” We’d shoot it again. It really turned out [well]. It was a neat video. Turned out well so that was fun."

It really turned out to be a neat video.\\n\\n The other neat thing about it was on the ground, when you watch a launch, you don’t hear what’s going on on the ICS (intercommunication system) in the cabin. All you hear is the air-to-ground and Mission Control talking. So we also downlinked what we were actually saying to each other. You can go on YouTube and google STS-65 ascent, and you’ll see it. There’s also an entry video. You can see the entire entry from deorbit burn to touchdown. That’s out there on YouTube somewhere too. I got a DVD [Digital Video Disc] of it also, the whole crew does. We had videotapes, and we converted them to DVD. It’s really a neat video."

Shep, when he was training, was the first one to move in. They had just finished Cottage 3. They were still working on the others. There was a weight room in the basement. They were duplexes, but the basements were connected. There was a weight room in one, and Shep built this bar in the other one. We had a Ping-Pong table down there and television for watching movies.\\n\\n It was a social gathering place for all the folks that were working and training in Russia. We’d invite the Russians and have parties, and we’d have cookouts; shashlik, it’s a Russian kebab that they grill outside. It was a great social gathering place. The bar has been signed. Tom Hanks signed it when he was there. It’s got patches and stickers and everybody’s signature all over it. We were playing liar’s dice one night, and when I was chief of the Astronaut Office I called back to the States. We had decided to call Mr. [W.S.] Abbey. George was Center Director then. George said, “I think you need to talk to Mr. Goldin.” He had us on hold. The next thing I know he’s connected us to DC and we’re talking to the Administrator from Shep’s Bar."

People would walk in. I’d always talk to anybody. There was a lot of paperwork. I still maintained all my proficiency in the simulator. In fact I used it as an opportunity to see how other guys were doing. I’d go in the sim with them.\\n\\n Then you’re still supporting all the launches. At that time we were flying eight to nine launches a year. There was one period while I was chief, in a 12-month period we flew 11 flights. I spent a lot of time in Florida supporting launch and landing. When you consider delays to launch and weather delays on landing, I bet I spent half of those three years down at the Cape. I wouldn’t have traded it for anything. I think one of the hardest things is assigning people to fly in space, being fair about it, but riding out to the launch pad with them.\\n\\n I would have gladly gone in their place, not just to fly in space, but knowing the risks that were being taken. That was a good three years. We flew a lot; a lot of good things happened. It was an interesting time. We were doing the Shuttle-Mir Program, and that was a huge challenge. The first crews for Shuttle-Mir had already been assigned. Norm [Norman E.] Thagard had not flown yet, but Norm and Bonnie [J. Dunbar] were over in Russia training when I got assigned to be chief. They had just gone over there.\\n\\n My first trip to Russia was in January of 1995 to see how they were doing. I’d been chief six months. That was very interesting. John [E.] Blaha and Shannon [W.] Lucid had already been assigned and were learning Russian. They hadn’t moved to Russia yet. Then I assigned the rest of the crews that went—Jerry [M.] Linenger might have been assigned too. Andy [Andrew S.W.] Thomas, Dave [David A.] Wolf, I have to go look at them all."

They didn’t do things better or worse than us. They did things different from us. In some ways they were very inflexible. This was their system. This had provided them with success. They were going to force our guys into their system.\\n\\n Over time now we’ve worked, and they do things a little more like us. There’s more flexibility. It’s been an interesting process, but back then it was really interesting. I’ll never forget when I went over there to see how they were getting ready for Shannon Lucid. They had not flown a female cosmonaut in a long time.\\n\\n Shannon, good Oklahoma girl that she is, went over there and jumped right in. I was going through the apartment that she was going to live in and make sure things were right. General [Yuri] Glazkov, who has since passed, was in charge of Star City at the time. We were walking through the apartment, and there’s a brand-new washer and dryer in it. Glazkov didn’t speak English; he always worked through an interpreter, or you spoke Russian, but he knew some English. We get to where this brand-new washer and dryer are. I don’t even think they were hooked up yet. He goes, “See how much we love American astronauts.” That was in Shannon’s apartment. That all worked out.\\n\\n Brenda Blaha took very good care of John over there. She went over, and John had a great mission. It was hard for those folks. They had to learn Russian, pass all their tests in Russian, and it wasn’t easy. We got better at how we got folks prepared to go over there and train over the years, but a lot of that happened because of Shuttle-Mir."

        "utterance": "I got to Moscow and this was only a few years after the wall came down. Moscow today is not anything like it was back then. Even the traffic, they didn’t have all the cars that they have now. Out at Star City 1 in 10 lightbulbs worked. The linoleum was peeling up off the floors. The paint was peeling on the walls. Pretty grim in places. That all changed as we worked through Shuttle-Mir, and things got more stabilized over there. The Russian people, they’re good people, very warm and gregarious. They just grew up in a different system than we grew up in. I think we had common goals, and we united around those goals.\\n\\n I’ve done a lot of traveling around the world, and everybody wants the same things. They want good things for their children. They want a future. They want food on the table. In the end people are pretty much all the same. I think we’re much more like the Russians than we are different from them in a lot of ways.\\n\\n So we learned to work together, and it was an iterative process. You had to develop relationships to develop trust. When you developed those relationships and developed the trust that came with it that helped from the technical point of view getting things done. Once you have that trust then you can work together. The relationships that I developed when I was chief of the Astronaut Office, they really helped when I was Manager for International [Operations] in the Space Station Program and other positions that I’ve had at NASA that involve working Space Station, having developed those relationships and trust.\\n\\n I just remember I was over there, my first trip. I’m a colonel in the Marine Corps. Christer Fuglesang and I, Christer was a Swedish astronaut that was training over there to fly, went out cross-country skiing in the middle of the night. It’s eleven, twelve o’clock at night, and we’re skiing through holes in fences and all around [to see] what was this secret city. It wasn’t even on a map. I’m thinking, “This is surreal.” It was just so neat in the woods in Star City cross-country skiing in the middle of the night with a Swede. That was pretty cool just seeing Star City for the first time, the training facilities, how they operated compared to how we operated, all that learning. I got to admit, when I got back to Sheremetyevo and got on the airplane and when the landing gear came up it was like this sigh of relief. It was like, “Ah, I’m going home.” That changed over time, but that first trip was still pretty much like it was during the Soviet Union in Moscow. I [didn’t feel] totally comfortable.\\n\\n Then when I lived in Russia, I felt more at home in Moscow than big cities in the United States. I felt totally comfortable there, but again that’s a learning process. It’s getting to know customs, people, the language, and so on. [I] used to give tours. I could give a better tour of Moscow than a lot of folks when folks would come over and visit. I had Russians come up to me on the street and ask me for directions."

Working for Bill [William H.] Gerstenmaier when I was over in Russia, it was really a challenge, because Bill was looking for ways to cut money and continue to build Space Station. So I took significant budget cuts to our operations in Russia. It’s continued to today. Today it’s just extremely challenging with the flat budget to do everything that we’re doing.\\n\\n At KSC going into this next year we’re $16 million under what we really should have.

Jerry was lead EVA guy in the office, and this was the first assembly flight. It had three spacewalks on it which were challenging. Jim [James H.] Newman has great skills from a computer point of view and also EVA. Nancy [J.] Currie, superb robotics arm operator, and we had some challenging robotics tasks on that first flight.\\n\\n Guess that’s everybody. Then we got a crewmate added on partway through the training flow. Sergei [K.] Krikalev joined us. Sergei had flown on the Shuttle and ended up being on the first Space Station crew. They knew he was going to be assigned to that first crew, so they thought it’d be good to get him up there during this assembly mission. The Russians were pushing to having a crewmate on board since it was the first assembly mission, and it was the right answer.\\n\\n I think one thing if I had it to do over again, instead of having Jim and Jerry do all three EVAs, I would have split it up so everybody did two. I’d have put Jim and Jerry together on one, Jerry and Sergei on one, and Jim and Sergei on one. Hindsight is 20/20. It all worked out great. The EVAs went superb.\\n\\n A number of challenges too. The Russian FGB had a couple of antennas that didn’t deploy properly, and the guys were able to deploy them during the EVAs. The advantages of having humans in space, being adaptable and fixing things when they aren’t exactly right. Yes, that was neat. Had to make sure I had a crew that was up to the challenge."

The rest of the crew thought we were nuts, thought I was going to get hurt.\\n\\n We did a lot of fun stuff together just traveling around. We were in a Russian grocery store before they’d all been converted to Western stores. Under the Russian system, I think it was a jobs program. You went into a store. There was a produce section, a dairy section, and a meat section. If you wanted to buy something from the meat counter, you went up to the meat counter. You waited in line to get to the meat counter, and you said, “Okay, I want a pound of that.” You got a little chit, went back to the cash register, and paid for it. Then you got back in line to give them the chit to show that you paid for it, so that they would give you what you paid for.\\n\\n We were in the store, and Newman wanted to buy some milk. Moloko is the Russian word for milk but he couldn’t remember it, so he just holds his hand out like this [demonstrates]. He goes, “Moo.” He got his milk. Common international language there.

We went to Goose Bay, Labrador, to Ireland, to Moscow. It wasn’t Goose Bay, Labrador, it was another one of our abort sites up there in Newfoundland. I can’t remember.

They always sit people through a relationship of one sort or another that are talked about in the State of the Union address. They had representatives sitting next to the First Lady in her seats.\\n\\n So I ended up sitting next to Hillary Clinton because they were going to talk about first Space Station assembly mission then the speech got rewritten the day of the State of the Union address. Instead of talking about the Space Station, they talked about John [H.] Glenn flying a month prior to our mission. It was still a NASA connection and space. It was really neat to be there for the State of the Union address sitting next to the First Lady, and then being invited to the White House for the reception afterwards. That was very cool, very cool.\\n\\n One of the other things we did on that flight was deploy an Argentine satellite. SAC-[A] I think was the name of it. We went down to San Carlos de Bariloche in the Patagonia area of Argentina, where their Argentine science center is, to train on the satellite. While we were there, the president was meeting with the president of Argentina for a summit. They were also in San Carlos de Bariloche while we were there.\\n\\n Mr. Goldin was supposed to introduce the president at this event, because it was at the science center, and the NASA connection. He said, “I can’t do it. I have to go back to Washington.” I can’t remember why. He says, “I want you to introduce the president.” “Yes, sir.” So I wrote a speech to introduce the President of the United States, got it blessed by the White House. I’m up on stage with the President of the United States and the president of Argentina, with the mountains behind us, and this beautiful blue lake. I have this picture, and I introduced the president at this conference.\\n\\n It’s a really neat picture. So I took it with me to the White House at that reception after the State of the Union address. I went up to the president, and I asked him if he would sign it for me. I didn’t expect him to remember me from Adam. “Sure, Bob.” Very charismatic man, Mr. [William J.] Clinton. He put, “Thanks for your leadership in space, Bill Clinton,” on the picture, so I got that framed.\\n\\n The other interesting thing I remember from that evening was while I was waiting to talk to the president, Jesse Jackson was talking to him. He’s a big man. I mean Bill Clinton is a big man, but I think Jesse is a little taller than President Clinton. He’s thumping the President of the United States on the chest as he’s talking to him.

We were down, but not that down, smiled for the media, looked good getting out of the Astrovan going back to crew quarters. Get to do it again.\\n\\n That next day in the Orlando Sentinel, and I think it was in Florida Today too, after the storms came through, there was this picture of a rainbow over Endeavour sitting on the launch pad. It was beautiful. The next night, we went out, and it was just as smooth as could be. It was just a perfect launch count, perfect launch. Everything just went like clockwork, just really really well.\\n\\n Our first day on orbit, the wakeup music my daughter had selected was “Somewhere over the Rainbow” by Judy Garland. It brought tears to my eyes. I tell folks somewhere over the rainbow dream do come true, because we launched over that rainbow and we had an absolutely dream flight from start to finish. Just went perfect. That was special. Yes, things just weren’t right on that first launch attempt. We could have gone if it all worked out, but I’m glad that it wasn’t when we launched, because the next night everything was just perfect, and the weather was better, everything was better."

She had less than an inch of clearance on either side. It was like watching grass grow. Perfectly out, we positioned it over the Orbiter docking station with PMA [Pressurized Mating Adaptor]-1. I fired the thrusters to bring the two pieces together just like you dock with Space Station. She positioned it with the arm. Then we lift the arm, fire the thrusters, and then the APAS, (Androgynous [Peripheral Attach System]), a docking system, brought it together. Jerry Ross was working the docking system. He was in charge of all the switches. Everything worked perfect, drove the latches, and Unity was secured to the Orbiter docking station. Then we did the rendezvous with the FGB, Zarya, which means sunrise in Russian. The rendezvous went flawlessly. It was really good. That was a little bit exciting. Did I share that excitement with you last time?"

        "utterance": "As I said the rendezvous went flawlessly. Jim Newman, prior to becoming an astronaut, was one of the trainers in rendezvous and prox ops [proximity operations]. He wrote a program for the PGSC [Payload and General Support Computer], the onboard personal computer, that was called RPOP (Rendezvous and Proximity Operations Program). It basically showed your rendezvous profile with predictor dots on where you’d be at certain times and what would happen if you did certain things. You could see the whole thing, follow it. It was a very nice visual representation of the rendezvous and where you were going.\\n\\n I had RPOP; I had the Shuttle onboard computers; I had the Ku-band rendezvous radar. Somebody was using handheld laser to get range and range rate, and I had Jim Newman giving me verbal advice all through the whole thing. “What do you think about a couple of ups? How about an in?” I’m using my Kalman filter to filter all that and do what I think was the right answer. It all went flawlessly.\\n\\n I flew the FGB down into the payload bay, and I couldn’t see it out the windows because the node was blocking our view. So I had a centerline camera looking up at it and a camera on the end of the arm looking across at it. I’m watching it on the two TV monitors. I got it perfectly stable, and we’re waiting to get over a Russian ground site so that they confirm the FGB is in free drift, because you wouldn’t want to grab it with the arm and have its flight control system on, have it fight the arm, and break the arm. So you have to make sure its control system is off.\\n\\n While we were waiting to get over a Russian ground site, the Orbiter maintains its attitude. There’s six degrees of freedom that you can fly. It’s hard to do all that. So we programmed the autopilot to hold the Orbiter’s attitude then all we have to worry about are the translations. It hit a dead band. There’s an area where it doesn’t fire the jets as long as it’s within that dead band, and it’s proper in pitch, roll, and yaw. As it slightly drifts and it hits a roll dead band or a pitch dead band, it’ll fire the jets to center it back up. When it does that you don’t get a pure roll, pitch, or yaw maneuver. It couples into a translation. When it did, all of a sudden, this 45,000-pound mass is moving into the payload bay and towards the arm. So I started firing the thrusters to back away from it, and nothing happened. It’s still coming at us.\\n\\n You program the digital autopilot [DAP] depending on what it is that you’re doing. I had it programmed for very fine control at that point. Fortunately, I had enough good sense to reach up and go from the B DAP for very fine control to the A DAP, which had more control power, and started firing the jets, and we backed away from it, and then came back and got all stable again, ready to grab it.\\n\\n When that happened, there was just dead silence in the cockpit. Got my attention. I mean it wouldn’t have been good if it would have hit us. That would have been the end. Newman always had all that advice during the rendezvous. When it was all done, I turned to Jim and I said, “Hey, Pluto,” his dog name. I said, “Pluto, how come you didn’t have any advice for me there?” “Well, I know when to keep my mouth shut.” That was probably the most exciting time on orbit. Fortunately I knew what to do.\\n\\n We got over a Russian ground site, and they cleared us to grab it. Nancy grabbed it with the arm. The Orbiter flies so well. In the simulator I got it like three feet away from the end of the arm. I could just fly the arm onto it, but I let Nancy grab it.\\n\\n She lifted it up. We couldn’t actually see. We’re using camera views to make sure that it’s centered. We had this system on board where we had a bunch of dots on the node and on the FGB, where using visuals and computers it would tell you if you were aligned or not, but it didn’t really work all that well. We had some other graphics that we were using of what it should look like. We got it all positioned over the PMA-2 on the node and lifted the arm and fired the thrusters again and brought those two pieces together, drove the latches, and that was it, they were linked together.\\n\\n Then we did the spacewalks to hook up the data and power connectors. We actually disconnected some stuff so that you couldn’t fire things to separate the two pieces; they’re joined. It’s not coming apart.\\n\\n I’ll never forget when we got to go inside, open up the hatches and go in for the first time. That was pretty cool. Sergei and I went in side by side through every hatch. I’m the first American, and he’s the first Russian to enter the Space Station, but we entered as an international crew side by side."

He was up on the flight deck doing e-mail and looking out the window, and he decided to go back into the Space Station one more time before he went to bed.\\n\\n He went through the hatch down on the middeck. It’s totally dark. Everybody’s sleeping. He was going back through these huge bags where the airlock used to be on the middeck—these huge bags full of parts and supplies for the Space Station— now it was in the payload bay, making sure he doesn’t wake me or Nancy Currie up, CJ and Jerry are off plastered on the wall elsewhere on the middeck.\\n\\n He goes into the airlock, turns through the PMA, into Node 1, and who does he see but me and Sergei Krikalev. We stayed up till like 4:00 in the morning, just working and talking inside the Space Station. That was really cool. Never forget that. Talking about the future, what it meant. International cooperation, what the Space Station was going to be. How important this was, and how neat it was just to be up there together laying the cornerstone for the Space Station. That was a neat night.\\n\\n Finally I said, “Guys, we got a really busy day tomorrow. We got to get some sleep.” I made us all go to bed. So we got about three hours of sleep, and then we got up for another really busy day."

I said, “I’d like to get full-time Russian language training before I go.” I knew a little bit of Russian from being chief of the office and traveling back and forth to Russia. I have a little bit of an ear for languages, but I wanted formal training so I was really good. Tommy said, “Absolutely, but there’s a couple things I’d like you to finish before you go into full-time Russian language training.”\\n\\n He never did let me get full-time Russian language training. I’d get to work at 6:00 in the morning. I’d work in the Space Station Program till 8:00. I’d go take Russian language class from 8:00 to 12:00.

He was a tutor to make extra money part time. He had his own way of teaching Russian. This was the way he taught it to non-Russian language speakers as a university professor. So I had a new set of books, and I had a class once a week with him.\\n\\n I was reading Russian poetry at the end. I think [Sergei A.] Yesenin was a better poet than [Alexander S.] Pushkin. I liked his poems. He hanged himself in Saint Petersburg. Sad life, but he wrote some good poems. I was actually giving speeches in Russian when I was there. I used to have to write them out.

We went through a lot during that timeframe. I’ll never forget. Ken Bowersox, Don [Donald R.] Pettit, and Nick [Nikolai M.] Budarin were coming home from the fourth increment. Frank was Increment Three. Those guys were Increment Four I think it was, or Five. Now I’d have to go back and look. They had a ballistic reentry. I was over in Kazakhstan to go out, greet them at landing, as part of the contingent, seeing how things went.\\n\\n We’re on this Russian helicopter, the weather is lousy, and we’re just flying forever, and they’re not where they were supposed to be. We didn’t know all the details. We’re trying to find out why aren’t they where they were supposed to be. Having just lost Columbia, now I’m dealing with a Soyuz vehicle that landed short.\\n\\n The Soyuz is a very robust vehicle, and it’s capable of a ballistic reentry as opposed to a guided reentry. They were about 300 kilometers short of where they were supposed to be. They got out okay. Because they landed short, we didn’t have enough fuel for all the helicopters. We didn’t end up taking everybody there. I ended up waiting, didn’t get to go all the way to the landing site. Talking to Sox afterwards, they got themselves out of the vehicle on their own. Ken says the thing he remembered most was the smell of the Earth when they opened the hatch.\\n\\n Don wasn’t feeling all that great. They got everybody out, and they just basically sat there and waited for the recovery team to show up. That was scary for a while. It was great when we heard they were okay."

Using the resources we have and the budget that we have, this is the right answer for what we’re doing now, although we got to be careful that it’s not underfunded also.

Every flight, as good as we got at putting foam on the vehicle, there was always a little debris that ended up striking the vehicle. It was minor. Look at Atlantis right now in the Visitor Center at KSC, and you can see a couple of dinged tiles. That was probably the cleanest flight that we ever flew, perfect flow. That went really really well, that Orbiter flow. Very clean vehicle when it got back. Every flight had tiles that either needed to be replaced or repaired.\\n\\n Hindsight is always 20/20. On my first flight, we had a strike on one of the tiles right behind a carrier panel. The carrier panels were right behind the RCC [Reinforced Carbon-Carbon], and then a tile right behind that took a hit. It gouged it really well. You could look up, and it actually slumped the aluminum, the metal, back behind the tile. “Geez, you’re going to have to repair that before it flies again.” We never really thought that much about it.\\n\\n On my last flight, if you look at the video, there was a huge hunk of foam that came off the intertank flange. It just missed the Orbiter. We were lucky.\\n\\n That’s the advantage of having a capsule on top of the rocket. You’re out of that debris zone. Plus, you have an abort capability that gets the capsule off the rocket if there’s ever a problem. Much easier than getting the Orbiter off the stack, depending on when it happens to safely get the crew down."

I think it brought up training that’s required. You’re not going to be able to stop somebody that really wants to do that on Center. Guns are illegal on federal facilities, but we don’t stop [everyone]. We do random checks. We rely on our security training to help prevent it. If somebody wants to come on board [with a gun], chances are you’re not going to catch them with a random check, they’re going to get on board.\\n\\n So what we need to do, and I think what we’ve done, is help folks recognize when somebody [is struggling]. In any situation where somebody has done something like that, there are issues leading up to it that had they been recognized you might have been able to stop it.\\n\\n Folks always look back and say oh, yes, he wasn’t acting quite right, or she wasn’t quite right. I think stressing the NASA family, stressing how we look out for one another, if we truly do that and we recognize when folks have issues and we help get them the counseling that they need, you can help prevent something like that. You’re not going to stop it with your security force, then you’re in a reactive mode. Having the training to help in a situation like that is really good. We trained for it at KSC. I know it’s trained for here. We provided training to people.\\n\\n This isn’t something that happens just at NASA. If you look across our country right now, these crazed people with guns that have gone into malls and schools, you can’t just be a target. If there is a lone gunman in a confined area with 50 people, yes, some people are going to get hurt, but you can react to that and do the right thing to stop it before hundreds of people are hurt. It’s not easy but there are things you can do.\\n\\n From a NASA point of view where it’s a single incident like that, a single person that ends up taking their own life, which is really sad, there are issues that probably could have been caught ahead of time had they been handled properly then. It’s ensuring that we provide that kind of training to folks to help recognize when somebody needs help. I think we’ve done that, but it’s something that needs to be constantly reinforced.\\n\\n You always have new people coming on board that you have to integrate into your family. You need to ensure that they get that training too. That was sad."

You tackle it through knowledge and training and understanding, and as you gain that, challenges are whittled down. Initially working with the Russians was a challenge. Integrating our programs together to be able to do the International Space Station. Learning Russian language was a challenge. Being chief of the Astronaut Office was a challenge. All things are challenging, but they’re rewarding. You just got to put the effort into them.\\n\\n I tell folks the first time I saw inside the Shuttle simulator. How am I going to learn all this? I’d flown some sophisticated aircraft. It’s like anything else, you learn it one system at a time, one bit at a time, the nominal, then the off-nominal procedures then you integrate all the systems together. Pretty soon you know it all. It’s just a matter of working through things. It helps to have a good team, and we are blessed at NASA. The folks that are part of this Agency, that are part of the Johnson Space Center, the Kennedy Space Center, wherever, they’re there because they want to be there, not because they have to be. It’s not just a job. For most of us it’s a vocation, it’s a calling, it’s something that we really want to be a part of that’s important.\\n\\n When you have that, when people are passionate about what they do, and they want to be a part of it, it makes it a whole lot easier. Why is NASA the number one agency for the last three years and hopefully again for the fourth year in our federal government? I think it’s for a couple reasons. First off, I think it’s because we have a meaningful mission. People want to be a part of it. They’re making a difference in the world. That is very important. I think it’s also the way we take care of one another. We care about the people in the team. We really do look after the folks that work at our centers and in our Agency.\\n\\n I think that meaningful mission really helps too to make us number one. So everything’s a challenge in what we do in human spaceflight and at NASA. There’s nothing that’s not challenging, but it’s all very rewarding, and it’s all very achievable as you work through things step by step and build on your past experiences to help you with your future work."

The first Space Station assembly mission, having that success, having it go as well as it did, and setting the stage for the construction of the International Space Station, setting the tone for how it was to be done, how to work with our international partners, how to be successful on orbit, how to work with the team on the ground, all the testing that we did, everything. That was a huge accomplishment. I’m really proud of that, how well it went. I was very fortunate to be the commander, and I think it went extremely well. But that’s flying in space, that’s technical.\\n\\n I think working with the Columbia families in the recovery after Columbia and getting us flying again from a team point of view, from an emotional point of view, dealing with all of that, I think that was important. I think we did the right things to get us back to flying again. I feel very badly that it had to happen, but I don’t think we could have done it better than we did on the recovery and return to flight and how we dealt with the families. I think that was all done extremely well. I’m very proud to have been a part of that.\\n\\n I’m proud of how all the missions went while I was chief of the Astronaut Office. That was an awesome three years. We did a lot."

I think one of the greatest contributions of the Shuttle is that it brought diversity to America’s space program. You look at that first group in ’78, and you had men, women, black, white, Hispanic, Asian. A very very diverse astronaut corps as opposed to a bunch of white military test pilots with a few white scientists thrown in at the end. I think that’s really special.\\n\\n Astronauts are no different than anybody else. We’re just very fortunate to have gotten to do what we did. We’re passionate about what we do. My passion has always been flying. That’s all I ever wanted to do. One thing led to another. Being a pilot led to being a test pilot, [which] allowed me to be an astronaut. I never dreamed I could be an astronaut. I held those guys in such high esteem when I was growing up, watching them on TV. Got to see Apollo 13 launch when I was a midshipman. The Physics Honor Society took a trip down to the Cape. I remember being in the Vehicle Assembly Building seeing Saturn V rockets stacked up to go to the Moon. Jim [James A.] Lovell, Naval Academy graduate, was commanding Apollo 13.\\n\\n I thought that was really cool. I thought wow, I’d really like to do that, but I didn’t see that I actually could do it. I know a lot of those guys now. I’ve got to interface with them a lot through the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation, through various events. They’re all just good guys. They just worked really hard, but they’re all human. Having sat on a lot of Astronaut Selection Boards and been chief of the office, they’re no different from anybody else. They do dumb things too. I think what they do all have is a passion for human spaceflight, for gaining knowledge, for expanding boundaries, for going beyond. They have persistence. They don’t give up. They handle difficult situations. I think they’re all passionate about what they do."

We’re going to continue to have astronauts with collateral duties being part of the space program, supporting other people flying. Then there’s going to be that preparation for the flight itself and the actual flying of the vehicle. With the longer duration missions a lot is asked. Going to Mars is going to be a challenge. We need folks that are adaptable. So many today, people in general, I think are a little less tolerant of having other than very nice conditions to be in. I think we need folks that are going to be a little more accepting of less than perfect conditions.\\n\\n I always had a test that I put things to when I was in the Astronaut Office. Is this better than living in a tent in Korea in the middle of the winter? Yep, because I’ve been there. I know what that’s like. I look from an exploration point of view. I think Shackleton’s voyage to Antarctica 1914 to ’17 when the Endurance got locked in the ice down there and crushed from underneath the crew. He brought everybody home. Unbelievable conditions, [but he] didn’t lose a person.\\n\\n We need folks that are able to deal with something like that. It’s like the book The Martian. What a great read; what a great movie. Very plausible, some of it, how he survived. We need folks that can deal with situations like that and survive, that have that will to survive, that will to adapt, that ability to think, to be resourceful. I think that’s going to be very important for future astronauts, and the ability—and this hasn’t changed a bit—to get along with others, to be a team player. That’s really important. It’s not about me, it’s about the team. We really need that to be successful on a long duration spaceflight on an exploration mission. Everybody’s got a role to play, and you got to play your role and be part of the team."

I’d been interested in the space program since we had one, and in electronics since I was four I think. That’s as far back as I can remember. But at the time I was interviewing I had several interviews with people like Western Electric up on the east coast. The head of the EE department—I have an electrical engineering degree—really felt like when companies came in for interviews their roster should be full. I saw that Philco was coming in, and I said, “I don’t really want to build refrigerators, air conditioners, it’s not really what I’m interested in.” But he believed that they ought to fill up, and so just because he asked me to, I went over and signed up.\\n\\n It wasn’t till then I found out that they actually had the contract out here, and I said, “Whoa, that’s quite different than I thought.” So I certainly accepted an opportunity to come over and interview with them. When I found out how deeply rooted they were in the US manned space program I just couldn’t resist."

        "utterance": "So that’s what got me over here in June of ’68. Now actually the first project that I worked on people probably don’t remember. But at that time the United States really had two manned space programs, the one everybody knows about where we were heading to the Moon, but the one they’ve forgotten about that was called Manned Orbiting Lab [MOL]. It was an Air Force program.\\n\\n The first thing I got assigned to—mainly because I was the junior guy on the team, so the junior guy always gets to do all the travel—we were integrating together the systems that were to upgrade the Air Force remote tracking stations and also generally building the first version of what we now call the Blue Cube or the Satellite Test Center [Onizuka Air Force Station, California]. Those were certainly going to be used for a variety of things the Air Force wanted to do in space. But the real driver to upgrade those was the Manned Orbiting Lab.\\n\\n That caused me to spend most of my time on the west coast. Did make it to a few of the tracking stations. Didn’t get to go to the Seychelles Islands one, which I always regret not having put a bug in that system before it got shipped. But it was a very interesting time. I look back on it, and if you got to pick a career path, I think that would be a great starting place for somebody who wants to design this stuff, because it was largely designed when I joined the team, and my job was to sit out there and try to get it all integrated together so it would work.\\n\\n It certainly leaves indelible impressions on you about the implications of your design decisions. It really did start me out thinking you better design this stuff to integrate or you’re going to have huge problems when you try to put it back together and make it play. So I look back on that, it certainly was not by design, but I feel like I was very fortunate to have started out my career in aerospace by trying to integrate a system that somebody else mostly designed.\\n\\n That lasted for about a year. The country then decided that the smart strategic position was to declare space civilian. So they canceled the Manned Orbiting Lab, the Air Force project, and put all the focus back on the civilian side and going to the Moon, and that’s what put me back on the Houston side, working on the NASA things. That’s a long answer to your question about how I got started in all of this.\\n\\n Fortunately back in Houston I was given the opportunity to work on a variety of projects. To set the stage a little more I think of what ought to be our key topical thread today is looking at the architecture of the [Mission] Control Center, how it’s evolved. Probably there are not many of us around anymore that remember what the first one really looked like. Remember, this was a thing that was built 50 years ago, mid ’60s timeframe, no such thing as personal computers, no such thing as smartphones. A computer was a very big thing and it didn’t do very much.\\n\\n The initial Control Center, which was in place when I got here, by that time it was about ’69. In fact I actually watched the Moon landing from Kodiak, Alaska. I was up there at the tracking station at the time. Got fussed at because we decided we’d swing the big antenna around and see if we could hear the LM [Lunar Module] on the Moon. The station commander didn’t think much of our plan. Almost had it too.\\n\\n The Control Center, initial one, was driven by several interesting things. First, I think some of the best innovative engineering I’ve seen in my career was done by the people that built it. Unfortunately I can’t take credit for any of it. But we had nothing. There was virtually nothing in the commercial marketplace to help us get there. So it was all very clever custom hardware design. Even things today that you can’t imagine as being some hybrid of electronics and mechanical things. Like one of my favorite stories is the initial display system that drove those small monitors in the workstations. The first one was a thing we called the converter slide file. The way the thing worked is there was a box about 2 feet long and maybe 10 inches wide. In it was a linear tray that held 35-millimeter slides. Each of those slides was mounted in a little metallic frame that had little dents in it that coded the address of that slide.\\n\\n On those slides was the background for the displays. Background meaning it might say pump A or bus B or whatever the name of that field was going to be. The way the thing worked is the computer sent an address to this box that told it which of those 1,024, I think it was, 1,000 slides in there it should pull up. This little robotic thing would run down there and grab the right one and pull it up out of the tray and move it up to the front and insert it in an optical gate at the end of the box, backlit optical gate. So the backgrounds on those displays were coming off of prebuilt 35-millimeter monochrome slides.\\n\\n Then the dynamic information in there where you had to say pump A was either on or off or some bus voltage was at a particular value was filled in by a device. I believe it was Stromberg-Carlson that built them. But it was called a Charactron tube. It was basically a double-ended vacuum tube that from one end of it you would fire an electron beam, and inside the envelope of the tube was a metallic plate that actually had the alphanumeric character set etched in it. So you defocused the beam slightly and hit the character you were interested in and then you took that resulting set of electrons that are making it through the hole that outlines that character, and repositioned it on the other end of the tube to position it in the right place on the screen.\\n\\n There were two 945-line cameras, 945 lines was a big deal in those days. The standard broadcast system in the US was 525 lines, so we called it high resolution. Today it’s very low res. There were two cameras. One of them was looking at the converter slide file, the background, the other one was looking at the output of this Charactron tube. Then you mixed the video between the two and the end result is you get the display with the static part and the dynamic part. I don’t know who actually developed that, but I thought that was one of the more clever things I had ever seen."

About the time I came over to the NASA side was when we were recognizing that raster scan alphanumeric display things were starting to come along. Certainly not like they are today, but there were fully pure electronic ways to produce those displays. Here in Houston Philco was involved in trying to do some of that, mainly because the Houston operation here was actually a branch office from the Western Development Labs out on the west coast.\\n\\n The Western Development Labs was heavily involved in DoD [Department of Defense] contracts, including the MOL one I mentioned earlier. They were under DoD contract seeking ways to produce better display technology for a variety of contracts, including the updates to these ground stations that I mentioned earlier. There was already some pure electronic raster scan alphanumeric display technology starting to be developed here, and it was considered prudent to get away from this very difficult to manage electromechanical display thing. There was only one guy on the face of the Earth that could actually make that thing work, with all the electronic and mechanical alignments that you had to do to get everything to fit just right on the screen. It was very labor-intensive. Not to mention the fact that there was a whole team of people that built all these 35-millimeter slides. Obviously you had to think about everything you want on the display well in advance, and they had to go design it. It had to be very carefully laid out so everything was going to fit back together. Then go through the photographic process to produce the slide itself. It was very labor-intensive."

If you look around, they’re about two feet long, look like they’re made out of aluminum. I believe Aeronutronic on the west coast built them, and since they did predominantly DoD contracts, it looks like they’d take a direct hit. They’re very rugged boxes.\\n\\n In fact when I came over to interview they were tinkering with trying to build full electronic displays. One of the things I recall seeing when I came over here was the prototyping on that. That led to them awarding a contract. Actually Philco bid on it themselves, but they were very careful about organizational conflict of interest, and since Philco was the integrating contractor for the Control Center, they walled off the people who were bidding the display.\\n\\n I think mostly for fear of appearing to be a little biased, they actually picked the bid from Hazeltine [Corporation], who was getting into the display business at that time, as opposed to their own. Actually I think Philco probably had a better design. But nonetheless that device was called the DTE, the Digital Television Equipment. It was a really big deal. It replaced all the mechanical parts of the thing. It allowed us to generate those displays fully electronically.\\n\\n It was a little bit challenging. In fact I think it was a little too challenging. Those displays, again going back and thinking of technology, in that timeframe we didn’t have solid-state memory like we have today. The only way you really could store things was in core memory. To use core memory to store the elements to produce displays really caused them to have to go extremely fast with the core memory. Probably too fast. One of the issues we fought for years with the Hazeltine DTEs was we would burn up the core drivers periodically, because we were really trying to push them too hard.\\n\\n But it worked very well. Each one of those devices produced eight channels. We call them a display cluster. The way that mapped between the mainframe computers and the workstation display devices is the mainframe computers would send—we retained the old converter slide file communication format because we didn’t want to rewrite the software in the mainframe. It would tell the Hazeltine device what display it was seeking to turn on in the old converter slide file format. So it didn’t actually pull up a slide anymore, the backgrounds were stored on a local disk.\\n\\n Then the dynamic stuff of course was periodically changing, was driven out of the mainframe to fill it all in. The composite video then was sent eventually to the workstations. What we had was the eight-channel clusters, the display generators, a big video switch matrix, and then a bunch of workstations.\\n\\n We had a TV guide. There was one channel that you could pull up and see what is already up and running. If you wanted to view a display that’s already up and running, then when you selected it the video switch matrix simply routed the display that’s already up and populated to your workstation. If you requested a display that was not running, assuming there was an available channel in the system, then the system would activate that display and connect your workstation monitor to the output of that display.\\n\\n You can see there were some fairly significant limitations. You only got eight channels per cluster. I think we got up to 15 clusters, but we never used all 15 of them for one flight activity. We eventually grew into two systems and we would allocate some clusters on one side and some on the other.\\n\\n There was a limited number of concurrent displays that could be up in the system. But it was still an incredible maintenance and operation advantage over the original mechanical system.\\n\\n That system existed over there into probably the early ’80s. I’m thinking around ’82 or ’83. Probably ’82."

        "utterance": "We use the term wearout, but it really has a bunch of things underneath it. If it’s a commercial product, which we use predominantly today, wearout probably means the vendor doesn’t want to support it anymore. They’ve gone three versions later, and they don’t want to mess with that anymore, so we can’t get any vendor support on it.\\n\\n Back in those days when things were much more hardware-oriented and mechanical in some cases in nature, wearout could mean actually the motors were giving up. The reliability maintainability group would monitor all the equipment, still does. We could see by where we were seeing failures occurring on a lognormal curve that they used that we would declare it in wearout. It’s becoming such a maintenance problem that it’s more cost-effective to replace it.\\n\\n The other type of wearout on things that are more pure electronic in nature is you can’t get the parts anymore. So if parts fail you may not be able to replace them. That’s basically where we were with the Hazeltine DTE stuff. The electronics that it was built with were becoming very very difficult to procure and parts give up and you have to replace them. The real driver was the growing maintenance cost associated with it. Interestingly enough, when it came time to do that I got asked to do the study to figure out how we ought to replace it.\\n\\n By that time there was lots of display technology floating around. There were numerous vendors building a variety of displays, certainly things had gone from monochrome to color, much higher resolution, full graphics, which the original DTE could not do. It could do very limited graphics.\\n\\n But interestingly enough, when I walked into doing that study I was predispositioned to think obviously we’re going to go buy something. It wasn’t until I dug into the details of that that I realized that was the wrong recommendation to make because the interface to that display system was so custom. Remember I said earlier the way it was communicated with went all the way back to the mechanical converter slide files. Of course there was no such thing out there in any vendor’s product, absolutely not.\\n\\n When I looked at the end result of taking some commercial product and modifying it so it could fit into the system, compared to the cost of designing from scratch a functional replacement for the Hazeltine DTE—and by the way, by that time with all the solid-state technology we had, it was trivial, absolutely trivial design—the recommendation I brought forward was let’s just functionally replace it. Let’s just build another functional equivalent to the Hazeltine DTEs. We called it DGE, Display Generation Equipment. It took two racks of equipment in a cluster for the DTE, and we put it in about five circuit boards, the DGE, to give you some comparison of how much technology had reduced that, it turned into an absolutely trivial problem. There was certainly no component that was under any stress at all in the DGE.\\n\\n Let me step back and say another couple things about the original Control Center architecture. It was certainly dominated by having to custom-build everything. Almost all the functions done in the Control Center originally were done in custom-built hardware. We had computers, but they were so slow by today’s standards, most of the high speed work, like the telemetry processing, they just couldn’t keep up. So we had very custom-designed frame synchronizers and multiplexers and decommutation equipment, and a whole variety of things were all done with actually a fairly substantial group of engineers, myself included, that did custom hardware design.\\n\\n When I did the study for the replacement—the other thing that dominated that Control Center I should mention, and it may have just been me because obviously I was a real neophyte at that time, but there was no vision of life after Apollo. We were commissioned to go to the Moon, that’s what we were fully focused on. We weren’t thinking about any kind of a follow-up project. Obviously there were a few things said in public about doing other things. But our mission was to get to the Moon, and so I guess all of us assumed that once we pulled it off they were going to dissolve NASA and we were all going to go find something else to do.\\n\\n But we didn’t think about it very much. Certainly a plan beyond Apollo was not a driver for the design of the original Control Center. It was rather tactical in focus. Not that I think the people who designed could have come up with anything much different even if they had been trying to build a system that had a 20-year life expectancy. But nonetheless that really was not a consideration.\\n\\n By the time we got into the early Shuttle timeframe and I was replacing the display system—"

        "utterance": "Probably about ’82. We had started flying, but barely, and I was asked to go do the study. That triggered a couple of interesting things. As I said, I wound up recommending a custom-built replacement. Although by that time moving away from custom hardware seemed to be the appropriate thing to do, the circumstances around that display system were such that it was more cost-effective for the government to go ahead and replace it functionally with a custom design.\\n\\n When I looked at the world around I said, “Everybody else is doing things a lot different than we are.” The original architecture for the facility was a computer-centric architecture. I’ll explain myself. I see big systems as falling into three categories. There’s those that are computer-centric, there are those that are data-centric, the heart of the thing may be a large database, and those that are by today’s terminology network-centric. Networks didn’t exist back when the Apollo Control Center was built.\\n\\n When I did the study to replace the display system I looked. I said, “The world seems to be going to network-oriented distributed processing systems. Displays are no longer generated in clustered display generators. They’re generated in workstations.” Even though the task I was asked to look at was only to replace the display generation stuff, it became clear to me that we really didn’t have the right architecture on the floor.\\n\\n Understand that from the original Control Center up until the early Shuttle timeframe the architecture did not change, but we’d swapped out every piece in the thing. It wasn’t that we had mid ’60s vintage equipment in it. There might have been a little of that lying around, but mostly all the key elements had been upgraded at least once, maybe twice. Mainframe computers were probably two models later by that time. As I mentioned, we replaced the display system twice, because it was originally this electromechanical converter file thing with the DTE and now we were going to put DGE in there.\\n\\n Even though the pieces were changing, and certainly we had a large effort to swap almost all the pieces out for early Shuttle to make it easier to maintain, it became very clear to me we really had the wrong architecture. It wasn’t just a matter of modernizing the elements of the system. The system structure was not correct. I’ll explain why I came to that conclusion, because this is really I think the important topic today, about architectures and why they get picked.\\n\\n Some of what goes on there actually is outside of what [NASA Procedural Requirements] 7123 talks about and some of the documented [NASA] systems engineering processes [and Requirements], which I think is important for people to understand. The thing that was wrong with that facility, we had gotten rid of a lot of the labor-intensive hard configuration items. We no longer were making 35-millimeter slides for the displays. Originally all the event lights on those consoles were hardwired to drivers, computers turned the lights on and off.\\n\\n Every time we tried to change the configuration of the facility you had to move all those wires around, so we had cross-connect cabinets, and we had a herd of people then that had to go in there and check to make sure the right light lit when the particular bit was set. It took thousands of hours to configure the system, which really wasn’t a consideration in Apollo at all.\\n\\n We had started moving away from that. We’d gotten rid of the 35-millimeter slides. We had done a project we called CONIS, the Console Interface System, which provided a bus-oriented communication out into the workstation to turn lights on and off. So it eliminated a lot of moving wires around and checking that. We still had to do a lot of testing to make sure everything was hooked up right, but it made it more of a configuration message that was sent to the console to turn a light on or turn a light off.\\n\\n We were making real progress on chiseling away at the labor-intensive nature of configuring the facility. But we were sitting there and I looked at our architecture and I said, “Nobody does business that way anymore. Everybody’s going to network-oriented distributed processing.” At least that’s what I thought at that time. It should be remembered that the Shuttle program early on was trying to get to flying about 24 flights a year. They envisioned being on orbit all the time with a Shuttle and sometimes having two up there. This was all before [Space Shuttle] Challenger [accident, STS-51L] and we decided maybe that was too aggressive.\\n\\n But when we looked at that facility, even where we were with the things we had done to make it easier to configure, the best we could do was nine flights a year. The system, the way it was architected, was still hard-configured, was still not very flexible. It took weeks to months to instantiate a different mission configuration in the building.\\n\\n Here we had a program that wanted to fly two dozen times or so a year. We couldn’t do it, absolutely could not do it. So we really couldn’t meet the program’s requirements. I concluded the basic way we had it structured left over from Apollo was not the way systems were going. So our ability to reach out and touch commercial products would be seriously limited because we had a structure that wasn’t consistent with the way the rest of the world was going.\\n\\n There were a whole lot of factors that got me to thinking that we really ought to go do something about it. Interestingly enough, Philco, probably Philco-Ford by that time, agreed with me. They set aside some of the company money to launch a study in 1983 to go look at that, which we did totally over on our side of the house. We certainly weren’t hiding it from NASA, but I don’t know that I advertised that we were looking at replacing it, mainly because the paint wasn’t even dry on all those pieces that we had swapped out in early Shuttle, and it didn’t seem like a real good idea to go over and tell them, “You know all that stuff we just spent a lot of your money on, we think it’s wrong.”\\n\\n Interestingly enough, in ’83 NASA came to the same conclusion independent of us. It was one of those phenomena that’s hard to explain. But they realized that we had this brand-new set of stuff on the floor and we really weren’t structured right. That eventually led into what should we do, and there was a lot of years that went by. Some of it technical, much of it concern from a programmatic standpoint. I’ll whiz through some of that. But the conclusion there was that we really wanted a net-centric architecture, not a compute-centric architecture. We wanted to distribute the computing so that we had some unknown number of workstations, each of which was a computer, and all the application layer would run out there. So we had no limitation in the system design then as to how many workstations we could have. Eventually we’d run out of room in the building I guess. But the system didn’t really care.\\n\\n The distribution on the local network was somewhat predigested data but not carried all the way to where it was analyzed. That was also very appealing to the flight control community. One of the things they disliked about the system early on was to get any analytical application produced, it had to get coded and placed in the mainframe computer, competing with everything else that was going on in the mainframe computer. It was not uncommon for it to take a year and a half to two years to get some new application in there, because it had to get fully defined in the requirements. Had to go off and code it carefully and test it to the nth degree because it was going to run on a machine that all the critical functions were running in.\\n\\n They didn’t like that, the operation community tended to have a little shorter horizon they were looking at then than what it was typically taking to get new functions into the system.\\n\\n Giving them each their own workstation they could play with was quite appealing to them. Eliminating their dependency on the mainframe computer."

        "utterance": "Yes, it was. The transition itself is probably a fascinating topic all by itself, because as you might imagine just from what I’ve said so far, generation two, Apollo being the first generation architecture, the one we’re talking about going to here is the second generation architecture, we’re on the third one now, I’ll describe it in a little while.\\n\\n It was a very radical change. There were many many things that were fundamental in the new architecture that didn’t exist in any form in the previous one. It was right on the leading edge of applying local area networking technology to something as demanding as real-time telemetry processing. In fact I think I jumped the gun a little bit. A little too ahead of the curve. We had a history of very centralized computing going to fully distributed computing. So, it was a very radical change.\\n\\n I do recall some of the senior NASA management telling me they weren’t at all sure I could figure out how to pull off a transition from one to the other, because Shuttle was already flying, and the Shuttle Program wasn’t going to stand down for six months or a year while we played with the system.\\n\\n In fact one of the difficulties in trying to figure out how to do that was the lack of real estate, [Building] 30M [Mission Operations Wing] was all we had initially, and it was full. Trying to figure out how to come up with enough floor space to put basically another system alongside of it to transition to didn’t exist. Looked at options about trying to stage it over at Building 17. I looked at trying to get trailers and move everybody out of 30 into trailers in the parking lot to free up as much space. Nothing was going to work.\\n\\n Fortunately in preparation for Space Station, when we got to thinking about it, we went and built 30S [Station Operations Wing]. So all of a sudden we had some real estate to work with. Otherwise we’d have never pulled it off.\\n\\n Knowing we had to transition rather seamlessly was a major system level design driver. I’m going to go back and recap some of the things that are really important considerations that you can’t find written in Level A requirements, that you don’t really find in the classically documented engineering process.\\n\\n I’ll explain exactly what I mean by that. We were looking for a system that could be configured quickly. The closest I could come to that is I did write a Level A that said we had to be able to transform the system from one activity to another in an hour or less, which seemed incredible at the time. Today we do it all the time. That one could be a real requirement. Many of the things we were after are rooted more in what I call needs, goals, and objectives that in engineering terminology can’t be requirements, because you can’t test them.\\n\\n If I tell you I want a system that can remain viable for 20 years, you’re going to tell me that’s not a good requirement. I’m not going to wait around for 20 years to try to sell this thing off to you. Those kinds of desirements are difficult to deal with in the classical systems engineering process.\\n\\n We had a lot of those. Many of the things that we wanted. For example, we wanted to have fully portable software. How many times do you have to port it before you can demonstrate you complied with that requirement? How many years will that take? It’s not a testable requirement. Very difficult to test if at all.\\n\\n Most of the real targets, the behavior that we wanted out of the new system, really weren’t deeply rooted in standard engineering processes."

Which is one of the things that I hope comes across in this material, because I’d like for people to understand there’s a lot more to consider when you’re building these systems than simply meeting the Level A functional requirements.\\n\\n The other things that were important to us at that time is I was convinced that we were on the brink of being able to eliminate all the custom hardware in the facility—we almost did it, didn’t quite—but that there was enough out there in the marketplace for us to go buy, not software but hardware. Which eliminated an awful lot of the cost of ownership. As you can imagine when it was locally designed and built hardware, then we had to do all our own maintenance, board level maintenance. You couldn’t call a tech to come in from the factory and do it, we were the factory. There was a huge labor force just to keep all that custom hardware working, not to mention the labor force it took to design it in the first place. I thought that the technology had gotten to the point that we could put the new system together largely with commercial hardware.\\n\\n Even on the software side, I felt like that we could go with commercial operating systems. In particular I wanted to pick one that had fairly wide industry support, because recognize, hardware does wear out, and you have to replace it, and you don’t want to rewrite all your software every time you do it, because remember, software portability was one of my targets as well.\\n\\n We went with POSIX [Portable Operating System Interface] as the standard that we were going to use—today we would call it UNIX probably—because many vendors were supporting it. I knew that whatever hardware models I went and bought, within seven years or so, I was going to replace them. They were going to be in wearout, the vendor didn’t want to support them anymore.\\n\\n I wanted to buy some insulation against the hardware, because the downside to going and buying COTS [commercial off-the-shelf] hardware is you can’t fully control your own destiny. If you design and build it here, you can maintain it as long as you want to, as long as you’re willing to pay the annual price to do it, because you’re sustaining it yourself. You’re not at the mercy of the vendor to do that.\\n\\n Knowing that when you go COTS, you got to be prepared to swap that stuff out on a fairly regular basis, the right thing to do is to make sure you put all your custom intelligence of the system in in a way that you’ve bought as much insulation against the underlying hardware platforms that you can, so you can replace them whenever it’s prudent to do so, and you don’t have to go rebuild all the software.\\n\\n We picked a POSIX kind of an operating system structure. Which I was told by many people there’s no way you can do real-time processing on POSIX, but that’s turned out to not be true. Although they did scare the hell out of me, I’ll tell you, they really did. Because some of the people who were telling me that I had a lot of respect for."

        "utterance": "Really both. There wasn’t very many places that that kind of real-time processing was being done at all. Even going back, the original, the real-time operating system we ran in the IBM mainframe computers, IBM built it for us here. Eventually they marketed it and called it RTX. But most of the time computers were checkwriters. They were being used in the financial marketplace but not flying spacecraft. They weren’t rich with the kinds of resources that you really needed.\\n\\n The UNIX kind of OSs were really designed to predominantly support a software development environment. It did things, for example if you had 50 users logged on the machine trying to do software development and compilations, it sliced up the machine evenly across everybody trying to use it. Really didn’t make any provision for prioritization of tasks. It was in the basic personality of those operating systems to not give you a rich set of features to handle the fact that some things are more time-critical than others.\\n\\n There was an element of truth in what they were saying. I still felt like we could put enough horsepower behind it and make it work anyway. The benefit of getting something that was pretty much industrywide supported outweighed the difficulty that I might have in getting it all to play right.\\n\\n We were trying to accomplish a lot of things there. There was a fairly long list of targets, many of which you could not represent in the documented requirement set, because there was no reasonable way to go test the system at delivery time to prove that you met that. So, most of the drivers were really hung out over here on the side.\\n\\n But we did produce it. As I mentioned earlier, and I’ll give you a couple of examples, I knew from the beginning that I had to put something together that we could transition. We were not going to be between programs. We were going to be in the middle of a program. We couldn’t stop supporting the program. There were features designed into the system that would allow us to incrementally morph from the old architecture to the new one. Maybe that’s a slight overstatement.\\n\\n I’ll give you some examples. In the old original architecture we had some frontend processors. We called them TPCs in those days, telemetry preprocessing computers. They did the first level of decommutation on the downlinks for example. They decommutated the downlinks for us and ordered all the parameters up in a buffer. The buffer then was sent through a very custom set of communication stuff that we called the MBI, the multibus interface, that provided the communication path between the frontend processors and the IBM mainframe computers. Then the IBM mainframe computers did all the magic to the data. They were responsible for doing all of the computations for analytical purposes, generating all the displays, and driving the display system.\\n\\n The first step in the transition was to replace that very custom communications thing between the telemetry processing computers in the front end and the IBM mainframe computers with a local area network. Fortunately we could go get Series/1s, which was an IBM product that we could hook up to the mainframe computers, and with a little magic in them we could make them learn how to talk on a network. We went and built a device called the NDD, the network data driver, very cleverly named, that functioned like the TPC did, but it knew how to talk to a network.\\n\\n We switched first so we started trafficking the data between the frontend processors and the central processor across a local area network. That did two things. One, it put the network in place so now we could start talking about hanging workstations off of that network. But it also eliminated one of the very custom pieces of equipment that was hidden in the middle of it. Since it was transitional, the functional allocations between the processing on the front end and the mainframe didn’t change. The frontend processor produced what I called an NDM, a network data message, that was raw in that it was not calibrated—it was the actual bits that came down from the spacecraft—but it was decommutated. We pack those things in there as tight as we can, because we’re always very bandwidth-limited on the RF [radio frequency] links. There’s actually a bitfield in there. You got to sort it all back out to identify the individual parameters.\\n\\n The NDM was a raw form of the message. It had been decommutated and the parameters identified, but they were not calibrated. Trafficked them over to the mainframe. It did the same job it had done before where it handled all of the polynomial calibration on the parameters as well as did all the computations with them.\\n\\n It was expected at that time by me that eventually that message would go away. That was an interim step because eventually I was going to move all the calibration functions over to the frontend processors. Remember, the mainframes were going to go away, at least in my plan.\\n\\n It turned out by the time we got to that point in the transition where it was going to pull the plug on the NDMs, I had already replaced them with what I called a PTM, a processed telemetry message. And so it carried the fully calibrated version of it, calibrated in the frontend computers. When I got ready to get rid of the NDMs, the flight control community said, “No, no, no, no, no.” They wanted the raw values too, so I said, “Okay, we’ll just let them run in there.” But that was supposed to be a transition-only element in the design. It turned out it stayed around all the way through Shuttle. But who cares? We already had it in there.\\n\\n But, we did things in a particular way so we could incrementally shift things over. The actual transition from old to new was incremental as well. We had both systems up and running in the building. We would first switch over and go do some routine Shuttle on-orbit ops with the new system, but we flew all the critical phase things like ascents and entries with the old system, until finally we had a high enough comfort factor that the new system actually worked that we were willing to fly an ascent with the new system and declare transition complete at that point."

        "utterance": "No, I do not. It’s probably well documented someplace and probably remembered by other people. But it was probably in the ’95 timeframe by the time we actually pulled off the transition.\\n\\n It was incremental in two ways. One, we didn’t ask the flight control team to show up in a different place one day and just pull the plug on the old one. But it was also incremental in the way we designed the system so we could morph functions over from one to the other so that things appeared to be under control all the way. But it did influence the design. Certainly as I mentioned the NDMs stayed around for a very long time. They’re not there now because we’re not flying Shuttle. But still even on the Station side we have RIMs [Raw Information Messages] and PIMs [Processed Information Messages] which mirror the old NDMs and PTMs, the raw telemetry messages and the processed ones. There are artifacts of having to do that transition in what we now call the legacy system because we’re fixing to replace it again.\\n\\n Again you can’t write those in a requirements document. One of the key things in really understanding this architectural engineering is figuring out how you’re going to get there from here. Obviously if you can’t get there from here you’ve got a failed project. But also to understand what it’s going to mean to try to put an architecture in place that you think you can live with for 20 years. I’m going to say some more about some of the elements of that that I think are very important.\\n\\n You’re not going to get a chance to replace the architecture very often. That takes a lot of money. Seldom do the planets align and congressional—"

        "utterance": "Yes. I was looking for a word. Allow you to do that sort of thing. Longevity is a very very important element in producing a design at the architectural level. Let me define what I think architecture means. That’s an often used and mostly abused word I think.\\n\\n To me the systems architecture is talking about its behavior, especially its behavior in the face of change traffic. A system level design, you can hand me a stack of functional requirements, Level A requirements, things the system has to do. I could go draw you up probably half a dozen different structures that can meet every one of those requirements. In fact some of them would be compute-centric, some of them might be data-centric, some of them might be network-centric. But they functionally will do everything you’ve asked me to do. But over time they’re not going to behave the same way. One structure is going to be able to capitalize on things like network bandwidth or speeds just becoming better and better and better without us spending any money on them, the technology is growing, computers are becoming faster, they have more memory in them.\\n\\n Some of those structures would lend themselves to that kind of plug-and-play swapout better than others would. To me when you talk about the architecture of a system, you’re really talking about how well is it going to behave itself for the next 15 or 20 years. Some of that change traffic you probably can see. Some of it you probably can see. Some of it you cannot. A key element in a long-living architecture is building in some very carefully thought out modularity and flexibility. We like to call them pinch points.\\n\\n What you really want to do is decouple things in clever ways. As I mentioned before, we have what we call ER [equipment replacement] program. We typically try to swap out the hardware stuff about every seven years. Some things live a little longer than others. You know over the course of architecture that’s going to last you 20 years you’re going to change all those pieces out several times. How do you do that without disrupting the rest of the system? Because you don’t do them all at the same time. The money is not there. Each fiscal year you’ve got budget to change out a few things. You have to have a certain modularity so that you can actually sustain the system, you can swap those things out without disrupting operations, without forcing a massive redesign on other parts of the system.\\n\\n The modularity is also driven by things like if you look out there you can see that certain technologies are going to advance because the commercial marketplace is pouring money into them. A common mistake, an example of it I think was in early Station. There was thinking initially that they would go ahead and run a 300-megabit downlink on the Ku band side of Station early on. Remember, that would get downlinked to White Sands, New Mexico. The question in my mind was how are you planning on getting that from White Sands, New Mexico, to Houston, Texas? Remember, back in those days, communication satellites was all you had.\\n\\n The people I was quizzing on that said, “Well, there are 50-megabit-per-second transponders on communication satellites today. By the time we need them they’ll be 300-megabit.”\\n\\n I said, “No. The commercial marketplace is spending their money trying to figure out how to slice up one 50-megabit transponder to service a half a dozen different customers. They’re not spending any money trying to build 300-megabit transponders. They have no market for it. If you take that position you’re probably going to wind up having to build and deploy your own wideband communication satellite, which I don’t think you’ve got in the budget right now.”\\n\\n It turned out the problem got solved eventually because everybody starts sticking fiber in the ground. Now we have lots of bandwidth from coast to coast in the US with all of the fiber optics that’s in the ground which is what allowed us to step the Ku band rate up recently to 300-meg and we’re fixing to go to 600-meg. Satellite communications is not the way we get it in; we get it in with fiber.\\n\\n One of the key things is when you look out there you can’t just assume everything’s going to get better. The speed of light is not going to change. If you’re going to count on something improving you better have identified the non-NASA commercial drivers that are going to make that happen, because we don’t want to have to go invent all the stuff ourselves. We want to be able to buy it. Some things, you can see those drivers, and you can count on them, they will happen naturally, and by the time you get to the next ER cycle you’ll have better things available you can go buy. Some things will not. Some things are not going to get better with time because there’s nobody wants it but you."

        "utterance": "We didn’t have Google. You couldn’t Google things like we can now. But still there were enough periodicals floating around. You could pretty well tell where the networking industry was going, where—I won’t call them personal computers but much more personal than a mainframe certainly—workstation class machines were going. You could look at the trends and the projections in the semiconductor industry about what they thought would happen periodically in terms of the speed of processors. There was plenty of indicators out there to give you clues about which things were going to improve for you.\\n\\n It also gives you some insight into—when you’re putting the thing together, and certainly the second generation architecture is an example of it, the things that you would be willing to be right on the hairy edge because they’re going to be self-improving, they’ll fix themselves for you. The initial instantiation of the network-based second architecture system barely had enough bandwidth on the local area network. In fact it really didn’t. I compromised the design some to make it work, but it was right on the hairy edge. I knew from what was going on in the industry that you wait a few years and that’s going to get really fast. Then by the time we get ready to replace it, that won’t be an issue anymore. You’re willing to take the chance there because you know the situation is going to improve.\\n\\n There are other categories of things where you might say, “I’m willing to be wasteful in this category because there’s a benefit. The category I’m being wasteful in will become less and less of an issue because the marketplace will fix it.” For example when we initially put together workstations the amount of memory that was in those things was very limited. Amount of processing power was very limited. And I was willing to get on the hairy edge on the processing power to do a whole lot of graphics in there because I knew that was going to fix itself with time. Without us spending any money those processors were going to get really fast.\\n\\n You can make decisions where some things you can project out with a fair amount of accuracy. You may not get the timeline exactly right, but you can tell where things are going to go just because the industry is driving that way. Not that you’re foolish enough to think you’re going to drive them. So, you can make decisions that say that we can be a little at risk here because it’s going to fix itself with time. I can be wasteful over here because there’s a benefit to being able to display data more graphically, for example, even though I’m really taxing the processor a lot. But that’ll fix itself with time.\\n\\n Some of those things are fairly easy to see. But there’s certainly a category of them that are not so easy to see. We’re sitting here today looking at exactly that kind of a future. As I mentioned, we’re on the brink—I say on the brink. We actually started doing simulations for certification Monday this week on the new system. It’s rolling into operations. Within a matter of a few months it will be flying the Space Station for us.\\n\\n It’s the same MCC. We only have one. Now we call it MCCS because we’ve integrated some of the peripheral functions in with it too, so it’s Mission Control Center Systems. But MCC-21 is a project. It’s the latest one where we’re pushing the thing up to the third generation architecture.\\n\\n Why do we do that? What’s different about the third generation architecture compared to the second generation one? What were the reasons why we thought a change was necessary? I’m going to throw a term in I think nobody in the world uses but me but I like it. I firmly believe in the phenomenon that I’ll call architectural wearout or architectural obsolescence.\\n\\n Obviously you can go use lognormal curves or some of the other things that are used to predict when equipment is going to wear out. But what that really means is when you look at the state, the configuration of the system you have on the floor, and the amount of money you’ve got invested in it, and what it would take to replace it, and the operational requirements that you’re seeing now, you’re trapped behind the power curve. The world has shifted enough on you that all of a sudden you can’t really support it well. I mentioned even going to the second generation architecture some of those things.\\n\\n Shuttle wanted to fly 24 times a year. We couldn’t do it. The architecture wouldn’t support it. So I would contend that coming out of the Apollo era going into Shuttle we were in architectural wearout. The one we had on the floor was dead. We could not get it to go where we needed it to.\\n\\n Today we’re seeing a variety of things that are shifting. First off, we believe when we look out there with commercial players involved we look at much more diversity in the kinds of missions we think we’re going to fly. We were used to having one or maybe two single big programs that went on for 20 years. Now we think we’re going to do one-offs. In fact we already have. EFT-1 [Exploration Flight Test-1] was a good example of it.\\n\\n We see the need for a different kind of flexibility. We also see the need for the capability to be a viable participant in geographically distributed operations. Where today if you look at our history MOD [Mission Operations Directorate] was it. We did the whole mission start to finish. The Control Center that’s on the floor was designed as a closed shop Control Center. Now we did stick Band-Aids on the side of it to support international partners, but that really wasn’t a driver when they designed that one. In fact Larry [Lawrence S.] Bourgeois was our MOD rep to the ISS [International Space Station] Program early on. He was quite emphatic that we were not going to do element ops. If the Japanese [Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA] wanted to play they could come sit in our building. If ESA [European Space Agency] wanted to play they could come sit in our building. We all know that’s not the way it came down. But the system was not designed to support geographically distributed operations, and so it’s been a little bit of a stretch to make it do it. But we see our future as necessitating that all the way around. If we go off and do some sort of a Mars mission, you know that’s going to be an international event. It’s not all going to fly out of [Building] 30. Other geographic locations are going to have certain responsibilities in that.\\n\\n We know in the interplay we already are participating in with commercial vendors that that’s the nature of the beast. The new MCC-21 architecture is explicitly designed to support that, which was not a factor in the second generation. In fact the Agency did us a huge favor—coincidental but I accept a gift anywhere. They had decided about the time we were looking at needing to do this to collapse out all of the Center level network domains and go to NDC, which is the NASA Data Center domain.\\n\\n Prior to that Marshall [Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama] had their little network and JSC had their little network. There were cross-connects across the Agency, but it was not one domain. By going to NDC, which is NASA-wide, one domain, that gave us a very convenient mechanism to exchange data between here and other Centers.\\n\\n Most of the participants that interact with NASA, even if they’re not a NASA Center, have NDC accounts and have access to NDC. That gave us a very convenient mechanism to build on. We changed our strategy not only from MOD flying the whole mission to being willing to work with other operational participants, but also even on the JSC campus of the role of MOD versus IRD [Information Resources Directorate].\\n\\n When I looked out there I saw several interesting things. The Agency had invested significantly in what we call our corporate backbone, e-mail and WebCAD and all the things that go on to make the organization work, where certainly not very many years ago the capability of those systems was not suitable for flying manned spacecraft. The criticality was too high. Reliability was not there.\\n\\n But today with the investments the Agency had made, they were very very close to the kinds of performance that we were used to for flying spacecraft. Certainly for the less critical side of our operation they were there. So, it seemed economically prudent to jump on their bandwagon. Plus the fact that they had provided us the very convenient mechanism for exchanging data with other NASA Centers.\\n\\n We split our architecture. At the very top level of the new architecture we have a side that we call the high side and a side we call the moderate side. The terminology used in there, we have MCE, which is the Mission-Critical Environment, and the MSE, which is the Mission Support Environment. We split it that way probably for two reasons. There’s a balancing act, which there seems to always be. One is I said the MSE side is sitting on the NDC domain. So it exposes those services in ways that it’s very easy for us to give accounts on the system to people at other Centers. It’s there.\\n\\n But the downside to NDC is, remember, it’s hooked up to the Internet, and people need that to do business. So it’s a little bit public. So to try to get the best balance between making our services available outside of our little world and yet providing the kind of security mechanisms that we really need to protect ourselves, we split the system.\\n\\n MCE, the Mission-Critical Environment, can be isolated away from the MSE, so that if we’re having a very bad day and NASA goes under attack, that does not compromise the vehicle or the crew. We have a safe haven. We have the right switches that we can throw, and we will not be corrupted by whatever might be going on on the more public network.\\n\\n Of course at the expense of some of that intercenter traffic, but if you were in hunker-down mode, that’s probably not the number one consideration. So we split it that way to get the best balance we could with guaranteeing that we provide the level of security that the country expects from us to manage these very expensive spacecraft, but at the same time build that element into the architecture that was missing from the second architecture to conveniently support interactions with people that don’t live here.\\n\\n The other thing that we changed in the system that’s a bit subtle, but very important, is we decided since the first one I mentioned was a compute-centric architecture, the second one was a network-centric architecture, we decided to go with a data-centric architecture. The reason is again even back when we did the second one we were flying Shuttle. We did real-time operations. The system is really designed to be a time now real-time system. That’s what we did mostly. Now the engineering evaluator guys worked in a different timeframe but they’d come get stored data and go off and analyze it, but it was a time now system. When we looked out in the future with the desire to go play with asteroids and go to Mars and flight time delays were going to get very long through the laws of physics, I can’t fix that. All of a sudden it didn’t look like time now was the right answer. It looked more like a TiVo kind of a thing where you needed to be able to slide a little slider up and down and say, “Well, here’s what it was doing yesterday, here’s what we think it’s doing about right now, here’s what we think it’ll be doing tomorrow based on our spacecraft models.” All of that obviously implies that I’m interacting with storage, with a database.\\n\\n We believe the best way to posture for the kinds of missions we think we want to fly at least—again this is speculative, it’s not really written in the Level As, but planning for the future—is to switch to a data-centric system. So, we have a thing we call Ops History. We gave it that name because that solves a real problem that we looked at. I probably should have said some of the changes always are not because the world has changed around you. Sometimes you’re changing things because you say, “Boy, I wish I could have done that the first time but the technology wouldn’t support it but now it does, so I want to change that.” Some of that are just flat lessons learned saying, “Boy, that wasn’t a good idea, was it?”\\n\\n One of the things that I felt like though we missed the mark on on the second generation architecture was a lot of data got generated in the system that the system common services did not manage for the user. They were just left on their own. They could write over their files, and they did occasionally. That was a real mistake. There really was no complete auditable data set that was kept by the system for them. When we put the data-centric element in it we called it Ops History. We think we have largely fixed that where it’s a very complete set of everything that was available while the mission was going. The raw data, all of the computations that were done, all the analytical results are stored in there, and configuration-managed for users automatically by the system.\\n\\n Part of that was lessons learned. Maybe a little technology in there, although file systems were pretty good by the time we built the second one. Really we didn’t go to the third of the three categories just so we could play with all three of them eventually. We went there because we think that is the structure that best suits our future. Some of it is speculative. But we wanted a posture so that if a new administration might suggest that we could go play with a Mars moon then we were positioned to be able to do that. Our system can support that quite conveniently.\\n\\n Other changes that we made architecturally. As I slightly mentioned the downside of opening it up is security. As long as you’re air-gapped the way we were basically, you don’t worry about security too much. Nobody could get in, the door is locked. When you start making the services available outside of your controlled access areas, however, you better worry about security.\\n\\n We made security in the system a number one priority in the new architecture. Security is not a Band-Aid that we stuck on the side of it after the fact, which is what it was largely in the second generation architecture. It is a primary part of the way the new architecture is put together. And it goes beyond just making sure bad guys don’t get into our system. It deals with again another artifact of where we think we’re going. There are different levels of sensitivity of the data. For example on ISS there’s some elements in the downlink that are considered ITAR [International Traffic in Arms Regulations]-sensitive that we don’t just give away to a foreign national unless there’s been some agreement made.\\n\\n There are other elements in the downlink that are medical private. For example any spacesuit data. There’s legislation that we have to guarantee we don’t distribute that inappropriately. But in general in the second generation architecture all of that was dealt with procedurally. You’re not supposed to look at that, so don’t. But there was nothing in the system that really prohibited somebody from looking at something they weren’t supposed to.\\n\\n With the new system we’ve built all of those data protection mechanisms into the heart of the system. Not only that, really I don’t think we could get away with being grandfathered like we were anymore anyhow. But even more importantly, if we’re going to start dealing with commercial vendors’ data, they consider it proprietary. They’re not going to want to play with us if we can’t protect their data.\\n\\n The new system not only has new security to protect us from the outside, it has security on the inside to make sure that we are fully capable of handling a variety of different data types, and even though we have multiple concurrent things going on in the building they don’t get shared with people who are not supposed to see them. There are a variety of new features in the new system. Also some of them that are more subtle. In the second generation system I mentioned the process we call recon, reconfiguration. Every time we get a new vehicle, every time we fly another mission, we wind up having to reconfigure for it. We don’t like to do anything twice.\\n\\n It’s a significant process even with a soft-configured system like we have now to regenerate all of the file products necessary to understand how to interpret the downlinks and calibrate things right. Unfortunately in the second generation system part of that process was all the way over on the client side of the network, simply because the network bandwidth was not enough. That’s the compromise I mentioned earlier. I could not fully process the data and make the client recon-insensitive because the end of it was we fixed that.\\n\\n The new scheme that we’re using to traffic messaging inside of MCC-21 totally removes the client side of those messages from the recon process. They don’t require any recon products. All fully self-interpreted messages. There’s also another element in this that has yet to happen, although I think we’re on the brink. I have this vision that I’ve had for a while that’s difficult to make happen, but to use the cliche OneNASA, a much more integrated ability across the Agency of the Centers to interact with each other.\\n\\n We designed the mechanisms that we’re using internally where they work equally well externally. The one I was just talking about, our internal messaging scheme, is very well suited to share data with another Center. It’s very efficient. Like I said the recipient Center does not have to know anything about recon for the vehicle. It also has security mechanisms in it.\\n\\n Also even the second generation system is technically what’s called a service-oriented architecture. To explain that a little bit, obviously it’s network-oriented, so things actually happen based on IP [Internet Protocol] addresses for source and client, but you don’t have to know the numerical IP address. It’s a little more like the way you surf the Internet where I know this URL [Uniform Resource Locator] for a Web site and I stick it in there. Actually that gets resolved in a domain name server somewhere where that name is matched up with an IP address which connects you to port 80 on that server out there someplace.\\n\\n You don’t know that, but that’s what’s really going on. We do that inside even our second generation system, but on a much larger scale than what a DNS does, a Domain Name Server does, because we actually rendezvous not only just with IP addresses but port numbers on the machine. So one physical machine under one IP address could be vending a lot of different services.\\n\\n Our whole internal architecture on the second generation system was really service-oriented. It did not connect with things by knowing IP addresses. It connected with things by knowing the name of a service or the name of a parameter, and it got automatically connected.\\n\\n Those mechanisms were largely built in the second generation system to work inside a system. They were not well suited for a wide area network. They were okay for a local area network. When we generated those functions in MCC-21 they were built where they can work quite well on a wide area network. It sets the stage for interactions between us and Marshall or us and KSC [Kennedy Space Center, Florida] to where we can take some of the techniques that we have proven over the now decades here to work well for us and push them out in the communications between Centers.\\n\\n We’re expecting some of that to occur going into EM-1 [Exploration Mission-1]. Some of the work we’re doing with Marshall folks and figuring out how we’re going to interact with them. They’re building the rocket, the SLS [Space Launch System]. It looks like they’re going to accept our TIM format, Tagged Information Message is the name we gave to this new way we traffic data, as an input. We’ve agreed to provide them software to read it. There’s an opportunity to save some money there but also to start a process of standardizing the way the centers will interact with each other."

        "utterance": "That’s right. We’re doing that. There’s a lot of it built in. Some of it is a natural artifact of opening the thing up to the outside. But some of it is making very clever choices about how things are done so that we already have the solutions in hand for the problems that have not been placed on the table quite yet but we think are there. You can see there’s a list of categories of things that need to be thought about when you’re fixing to rearchitect one of these systems. Which leads me to one of the questions I saw that you had on your list that I think is an interesting question. What are the big challenges?\\n\\n To me the biggest challenge, certainly if you’re working at the system architecture level, is communications. Let me explain what I mean by that. There’s probably not a large percentage of the community that’s running around figuring out where you want to be 20 years from now. It’s just the way life is. The majority of the people don’t think past Thursday next week. Building large systems is very much a team sport. It takes a lot of people to do it that range all the way from the architects at the top to the software developers and procurement organizations. There’s a large number of people involved, and there’s decisions being made all up and down this hierarchy.\\n\\n As I mentioned, there’s a fairly well documented process in systems engineering, 7123 for NASA, but there are many many descriptions of the engineering process out there. It really talks about how you have the set of requirements somebody wrote, you take those requirements, and a smart engineer does some designs and produces some sort of a design spec, and then that design spec becomes the requirements to the next guy. All of a sudden this thing decomposes all the way down to things that can actually be implemented.\\n\\n That’s all true. But what’s not in there are the things that defy being represented in those requirements. That’s the reason I mentioned that several times. There is a set of drivers that need to go into the engineering process at every one of those levels that is cognizant of where we’re trying to go with this. These are not things that we can consider requirements because you can’t test to them. But they’re things that cause me—of the five different ways I could satisfy these requirements—cause me to pick a particular one over the other four. Those decisions are made across the entire team.\\n\\n As you decompose one of these things it grows geometrically, and you can quickly wind up with 1,000 of these things going on, and one person can’t possibly be cognizant of all the decisions being made. So, the challenge is how you take those difficult to represent things that can’t really be requirements and communicate them across the team so this whole array of decisions that are being made on a daily basis really favor where you want to go with it.\\n\\n I don’t have a really great answer for that. I would love to challenge someone who might read this someday to think about a great way to blend that into documented engineering methodology. It may have to do with a set of categorical questions that might get written down and evolved with time, where as design decisions are made you go back and challenge them against these questions.\\n\\n Well, how will your design react if suddenly we have a mission that is going to involve three countries to go fly it? How are you going to tolerate that? How is your system going to respond to all of a sudden wide area networking is twice as fast and half as much money as it is today? Can you take advantage of that?\\n\\n Those kinds of questions possibly could be documented and used as a test and some guidance that when you get down into the ranks of the people building it to help them steer their decision process a little bit to favor the things that you think are important out there. The actual set of questions varies depending on the perception, but it may be a better way to try to communicate that across the entire team so that all those decisions they’re making that definitely affect the behavior of this thing, the architecture, are made smartly.\\n\\n That’s a challenge I guess to anybody that’s reading this. Think about how you think you ought to do that. If you believe what I said about architecture as a layer above a system design, if you want to see it that way, an architecture is all wrapped up in behavior and how well this thing may or may not behave itself over a period of time in the future, then the real question is how do you get the whole team to understand your vision of what that looks like, and the decisions that they’re going to have to make to make them consistent with helping to make that a reality.\\n\\n To me that’s the biggest challenge. Now of course there’s plenty of challenges in this business all over the place. If you’re designing hardware how you get it to go fast enough. But I think the one that really is the opportunity to break some new ground, do some good things for the Agency and maybe aerospace in general, is to figure out how to better address those somewhat elusive characteristics that a good system versus a bad system has to exhibit. To me a good system is one that lasts a long time. Replaced all the pieces in it, but the architecture is still there.\\n\\n I’m sure there will be a fourth generation out there at some point. Hopefully it’ll be 20 years from now or so. Maybe less. Maybe by that time someone will have a very clever way to have written an annex to 7123 to put all these factors into the consideration in a more formal and organized way than simply using the missionary process that we do today where you’re running around telling people and hoping that they understood what you said and go back to their office and think that way."

That happened over time. I think it was not as much of a culture shock because it happened over time. The more recent element, when we canceled the Constellation Program and the administration’s decision was to put more emphasis on commercial vendors, which I personally think is a great idea, the reality I think of you can’t own it all yourself anymore started settling in.\\n\\n You really had two choices.

We, FOD [Flight Operations Directorate], have equipment positioned at KSC and positioned at White Sands. We don’t really want to manage equipment at those places. We think they should have put it out there for us but they didn’t do it. I don’t think we got there because we were being self-centered.

        "utterance": "We take that job very seriously. Yes. One of the things I’ve discovered over the years. I’ll say a couple things about it. You walk into things thinking, “Oh, everybody does business the same way we do.” We found out that’s not really true. Give you some examples. Even in the US space program, we had been responsible for these vehicles from the time they left the pad until they landed, splashed down, from end to end. Things like understanding how to do an ascent design, which is a very complex problem that the flight dynamics people take on, to tune all those factors that have to be tuned to make sure you insert this thing exactly in the orbital window you want to put it in, most other parts of NASA have no idea how to do.\\n\\n The reason is the science community out at JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California] or Goddard [Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland], they go buy launch services from somebody. That launch provider figures out how to do that and delivers their payload to them already on orbit. You don’t find knowledge in the Agency on that side of the thing except here, because that was not part of their charter to do that.\\n\\n Interestingly enough, the way that came down, which people think I’m crazy when I say this, but it’s actually true. Remember when we started this whole thing out it was Mercury. We didn’t fly them out of here. Mercury was flown out of KSC. The start of Gemini was flown out of KSC. The decision to move mission ops here put us into Gemini before we were going to start flying them out of here. We’d already built the Control Center. It was online but wasn’t primed for the flight for Gemini III I believe.\\n\\n It just so happens at the time that we lifted off Gemini III and of course television was pretty primitive back in those days, the cameras were very insensitive and you had to have huge lighting to see anything, when they fired all the theatrical lights up down there, they brought the power down on the LPS, the Launch Processing System, in KSC. Right at first motion, we were already online. KSC went down. We said, “That’s okay, we got it.” That set the stage for why we took control of the vehicle at first motion. There was no other science in it, nothing else manned or unmanned launched anywhere in the world hands it off to the operations center at first motion. Everyplace else hands it off on orbit.\\n\\n But people should also remember back in those days from one mission to another things were very dynamic. We were told to get to the Moon and get there quick, and each mission had specific new things that we weren’t real sure we knew how to deal with. So, there was an attitude well, if it works, we’ll just keep doing that. When we took it over from KSC to here on first motion, that worked just fine. That just set the stage, we’ve been doing it that way ever since.\\n\\n But an artifact of that is we find that the knowledge that exists within MOD is unique compared to other space missions that are flown by NASA. Certainly we find more subtle indications of that. We have crews. The other missions flown by NASA don’t. Obviously the Russians do, Chinese do, some of them. But most of those missions don’t try to sustain what I’ll call a synchronous forward link, a hard forward link between the ground and the spacecraft, all the time. They don’t have anybody to talk to and we do.\\n\\n We find very subtle differences in how we want to do business operating through TDRSS [Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System] for example or the Deep Space Network or a ground station compared to what anybody else wants to do, because we have people on board to talk to, and they want to be able to talk to us. There are some very subtle things in there that are unique simply because it’s a manned program. I think there’s reason for MOD as an organization to be extremely proud of the breadth of missions that they know how to deal with. You won’t find that anywhere else.\\n\\n It just so happens that normally the way the functions are allocated they don’t all exist in one place like they do here. Self-serving but it’s true. We are I think a great ally for a commercial vendor that’s trying to get into the business or another country that wants to participate in some great adventure, because we really know a lot of things, and we’ve got a lot of years of learning where the landmines are and where not to step. There’s a great deal of experienced knowledge that exists within the organization that is relevant to pulling these things off."

If you’re going to take something fairly massive and accelerate it up to 17,500 miles an hour, it’s going to take a lot of power.\\n\\n Until somebody can come up with antigravity paint or something like that, this is just a very risky business. You’re dealing with huge amounts of power that you’ve got to control all the way down to the fifteenth decimal place. It’s a funny combination of precision and power that has to always be balanced out. It will get away from you very very quickly."

So the programs have defined a set of detailed objectives that they want for this mission and the job is to go fly a mission and produce those results. However, experience will tell you that the spacecraft don’t always behave right. Things break. You wind up in a troubleshooting mode. You wind up doing onboard system management and taking corrective actions mainly to try to protect your ability to meet all those mission objectives.\\n\\n Because things don’t go to plan—they never do, I don’t think they ever have—you have to be very very fleet of foot, very agile in your ability to replan to try to accomplish everything the program asks you to accomplish, even though it didn’t happen the way it was supposed to happen. It’s always been amazing to me. We spend an awful lot of effort planning these things out. We spend a lot of time running simulations, practicing not only the nominal but even more so the off-nominal. So often the off-nominal case that occurs is not one we practiced. There’s so many more things that can go wrong than go right that I guess just statistically that’s the way it is."

        "utterance": "No system is ever perfect. Certainly if it’s new it’s very imperfect. We will go into operations with MCC-21 with a lot of flaws, many of them known and some of them unknown. It’s always a calculated risk. We’ve never in the history of the Control Center had a system on the floor that had no known anomalies documented. Our DR [Discrepancy Reporting] database, DRTS [Discrepancy Reporting and Tracking System], or now we use a different system, but whatever it is has always got thousands of things in it, most of which are known to us, we have operational work-arounds. You’re used to when you fire up your PC, [Microsoft] Word is not flawless, PowerPoint is not flawless. We learn how to work around them and get the job done anyway.\\n\\n Obviously the newer the system is, the more likely there are unknowns. Our best protection, the way we try to get enough of a warm fuzzy to sign a CoFR [Certification of Flight Readiness] that we’re willing to stand up to the program and say we’re ready to go fly, is we try to log as many hours as we can testing and running simulations so the probability of having encountered those anomalies is as high as we can make it. Doesn’t keep us from discovering something for the first time when we’re on orbit, but the only way you can mitigate that I think is we try to to the extent possible have more than one way to do things.\\n\\n You try to make sure that you put in place operational work-arounds that are inherent in the way the thing works. If it can’t get it done the way I wanted it to, it may not be real convenient but there’s another way to do it. To the extent that you can anticipate those kinds of things and have the money to build alternate paths in the system, that’s about the best you can do. But I think we’ve had a history of deploying fairly well by systems.\\n\\n It was established very early in the program that we were going to operate to a level of “two nines five” reliability. That’s the probability of success or reliability number that says, “Well, what’s the probability of you being able to do your critical functions?” The number we established decades ago was 99.5. So there’s a half percent chance we’ll fail by the way, which we haven’t yet, but we’re due.\\n\\n It turns out that if you do that then soon as you say two nines five reliability, that means that for every critical function you do you have to be one fault-tolerant. You can’t get there any other way. For all of those things like being able to command the spacecraft, being able to process trajectory and know where it is, being able to view the telemetry, being able to communicate with the crew, all those critical functions, whenever we’re in critical or complex phase, depending on whether you want to use a Shuttle or Station term, we guarantee that we’re two-stringed. We have two separate independent processing strings up. If one of them fails, we switch to the other one. Of course that doesn’t protect you any for common cause problems where both of them have the same flaw in them. But typically even if it is a design flaw, coding flaw in the software, those things that are just flat logic mistakes get discovered very early in the testing process.\\n\\n The ones that’ll tend to propagate long enough down the timeline to get you past all the simulations and into operations are things that require a very particular time-ordered sequence of events before they can trigger. It’s so unlikely, that’s why you haven’t seen it before. Generally if you switch over and you do it again, the time order is not the same, and the problem probably won’t surface, even if it really is an implementation problem, a design problem, because you reset the roll of the dice.\\n\\n It’s amazing how often we have seen cases like that where we’re sure after the fact, go back and look at it, we actually have got a code problem in there we got to go find. Sometimes they’re very difficult to find because trying to reconstruct them, get them to happen again, when they’re improbable and very conditional. We do a lot of logging in the system to give us as much data to go back and look to see exactly what was going on when this happened, to try to reconstruct it.\\n\\n Generally another interesting design I think consideration today is the systems don’t have to be perfect. They have to get the job done. I’m a firm believer in what I call fault-tolerant software. You can implement it in a particular way where yes, there’s a bug in the code, but it’ll still get the job done. Maybe it forces a restart, the computer comes back up again and gets the job done, or maybe you switch over to an alternate path and it gets the job done. At the bottom line, you get the job done, and that’s good enough. That may mean you still want to go look and see if you can figure out why the heck it did that, or maybe not. Maybe if it does it so rarely you just don’t want to spend the money even trying to fix it. Nobody asked us to build a perfect system. They asked us to build a tool to go fly missions successfully."

No one was suggesting we needed to do anything about it. I had been off actually doing commercial projects. One of the other guys who was at Lockheed and I teamed up and we started a little company within the company. We were doing things for a variety of commercial companies. I’ll keep them nameless. Doing pretty well at it, but the corporation didn’t much care for us out doing commercial work. They thought themselves in the aerospace business, and I think they were a little afraid of us.\\n\\n We started backing out of that somewhat because it was not smiled upon by the corporation. It was a lull. There was going to be a change in the retirement policy that the company had about that time. It seemed like the right time. I went ahead and pulled the trigger and retired. I did occasionally go do a little consulting work either back for Lockheed or other places like DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency], but really wasn’t looking for anything like a full-time job at all.\\n\\n When we got into 2006 the Constellation was flaring up big time. Lockheed Martin out here was obviously a major bidder on Orion. They were using a number of the local people to try to work on that proposal effort. Because of the way NASA chose to run that competition that required them to firewall them away. There was a fair amount of work that needed to be covered over on the NASA side that there really wasn’t any resources to cover. That resulted in me getting a phone call saying was I at all interested in doing anything. I got to thinking about it. I said, “Well, engineers always demand symmetry.” That’s a flaw in the engineering mentality. Going beyond low Earth orbit when I started matched up with going beyond low Earth orbit at the end appealed to me. I think once you get the stuff in your blood you can’t get rid of it anyway. So I said, “Well, sure.”\\n\\n This was in February 2006 and I agreed to work the balance of that fiscal year over at NASA to help them work the Constellation issues so the rest of the Lockheed guys could go off and design Orions. Of course that was 2006 and I’m still here. They haven’t chased me off yet. But the fascination is still there. The opportunities are still there for us to go do great things."

You have things like the CCSDS [Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems]. It’s an international organization that develops standards for major functions that people need in space. Their objective is if you create a standard that’s internationally accepted then commercial companies will go design products to those standards because they have a marketplace. That’s worked, and that’s provided some tremendous capabilities for us that are not good for anybody that isn’t doing space but they’re commercial products.\\n\\n What’s available as a tool set to go build these things with is changing a lot. Just the basic technologies, how fast networks can run, compute power that we have in these workstations is phenomenal. There’s such a change in what we can do, the sophistication of the spacecraft.

We’re nowhere near finished in any one of these threads, including the methodologies.\\n\\n I like to leave that challenge behind for some of these bright people. One of the huge advantages of working out here is this is the smartest bunch of people you’re going to find anywhere on the face of the Earth. I know that to be true because I’ve been a lot of places. You’re not going to find a talent base anywhere close to this anywhere.

        "utterance": "It is not true. It is definitely not true. In fact if anything the rate at which things are evolving is accelerating. The opportunities are growing. It’s not simply working with new products. It’s even challenging old techniques.\\n\\n I had one opportunity in my career that occurred in ’91 when it actually happened I guess, rolling into 1992. The situation we were in was early Space Station. Space Station needed a Control Center. We were using a very classical engineering methodology they call waterfall to go create one. The program was quite unstable. I think twice we came within one vote in Congress of canceling the whole damn program. About the time we’d get through the front end and get a system design spec put together, the whole thing would flip over and you’d go back and start over again. We were executing completely in compliance with the contract, doing what I thought was pretty good work per the contract, but producing nothing of value that was going to go on the floor and go fly missions, because you couldn’t get that far.\\n\\n I think the reality of that was we were spending a lot of money. The cost to complete was basically not changing from one year to the next, and the schedule was just incrementally sliding out. I had a history of running around complaining about bad processes. I guess that was the reason why they said, “Okay, go fix it.”\\n\\n They gave me the opportunity in ’91 to go overhaul what was at that time the MSC contract. They didn’t put any bounds on me about changing the statement of work and the DRL [Data Requirements List] and anything else I thought needed to be worked on. I did that and changed a lot of things. In fact some people said I changed everything but the carpet on the floor, which might have been pretty close to the truth. But went to what today we would call an agile process. If I’d thought of that term back then I’d have used it. It’s a perfect term. I called in incremental because I wasn’t smart enough to think of agile.\\n\\n What it really said is hey, the world is too dynamic. The reason we can’t deliver on this is things don’t hold still long enough to use the long duration waterfall process. We got to build this thing incrementally. We got to eat this big cookie one little bite at a time, even though we’ve never seen the whole cookie at once. It’s all hidden behind a curtain somewhere. I reshuffled everything around so we could have a systems engineering level that was very heads up, keeping track of all the change traffic, and an implementing organization that were very heads down, that were taking each one of these delivery increments defined and going off and doing that without paying any attention to what’s happening to the budgets or the schedules or the politics or anything else going on.\\n\\n So we shifted to that. It was interesting, because when we made the change we gave the program back $70 million, I think was the number, and we trimmed two years off the schedule. But in reality that’s an inaccurate statement, because like I said, the cost to complete was staying the same, and the schedules were slipping. But the one that was baseline—and we delivered by the way. We met those budgetary commitments and schedule commitments.\\n\\n The reason I bring that up is it is useful and sometimes very appropriate to be willing to challenge the well rooted processes that are in place. If you can build a compelling case and it makes good sense for why you really ought to do it a different way, then people will listen to you. Obviously NASA contracts accepted all that before we were allowed to go do it. There’s plenty of ways to cause progress to occur. Some of them are deep-rooted technically. Some are more just how it is you go about doing it. But the important thing I think is always not just to say, “Well, it’s been done this way for 20 years, that’s obviously got to be the right way to do it.” The right thing to do is look at the situation around you right then because that’s what’s changing constantly.\\n\\n The operational requirements are changing. The technologies are changing. The budget situations are changing. The national priorities are changing. You’re really pressed to find something that’s not changing. If you’re not willing to be very agile, very fleet of foot, you’re probably not going to succeed. It’s all about being able to adapt. That means adapt the processes, adapt the systems, adapt all the things that we’re about to succeed.\\n\\n I got asked soon after we built the thing over there, after I redid the whole contract, the Air Force was on some kind of a summit thing in Colorado Springs. They were trying to figure out what to do with their systems in Cheyenne Mountain was what they were about. I guess somebody had mentioned what I’d been doing here in Houston, so they asked me to come up there and tell them about how it was we built the new Control Center here. I had a chart [in my presentation that showed the context the system engineering process must operate in]. Basically it was showing that the operations guys, are in a state of flux too. One day to the next they’re trying to figure out what the heck they’re going to do.\\n\\n Even made the comment that I could remember when I would have been the first in the line to go say, “Well, if those ops guys can write a decent ops concept I can sure build a system that would meet up with it.” Now the recognition that they would love to be able to do that but their world won’t hold still either. This whole chart was oriented around if you’re going to do good engineering these days you’re going to have to be constantly aware of all that change traffic out there, and modifying your plan to match up with it.\\n\\n It was interesting to look around the room, because I didn’t know anybody in the room, I don’t think. You could easily see where the ops guys were sitting in the back, they’re all standing up and cheering. You could see the systems integrator bunch that the Air Force had hired over there because they’re saying, “Well, doesn’t that cause requirements creep?” I remember answering that question saying, “Well, I guess. But what I deliver the ops community likes. So I don’t guess it matters, does it? It satisfies their need. I don’t know whether the requirements crept or not.” Because we started doing it before they were all written down. The requirements were evolving too. I don’t know what requirements creep means anymore.\\n\\n There are a lot of comfortable things that an engineering community can hide behind like a well formed set of Level As. It’s not in my requirements. I’m not going to do that. Those kinds of things are inappropriate today. The world is not that stable."

I see them taking the reins. I see them doing things that I can’t do, that I don’t know how to do. They’re more contemporary in their knowledge of the technologies, and very talented people. To me there’s nothing more rewarding than that, seeing what a bright future our program has with those kind of people who have a lot of years ahead of them to be able to contribute like that.\\n\\n Today is probably as good as it could possibly be. Of course you look back and you see some of the things that have happened over time. Certainly the day that we really started transitioning the second generation architecture in place was quite fulfilling to me since I was the thing’s daddy. You always like to see your baby succeed. Certainly if you look at some of those events back in Apollo, every one of those missions was very risky, very challenging. The organization and the tools that were available for them to work with helped us pull off some rather remarkable things I think.\\n\\n You have trouble finding a year where you can’t find something to be very proud of. I don’t think any exceeds today. Just watching what the team is capable of doing is incredibly rewarding."

        "utterance": "So far we’ve got enough testing with the simulations. The basic behavior that we’re looking for I think is actually there. It’s not finished. These things never are. We’ve been working on the Control Center for 50 years, never have finished it. It’s not so much a point, it’s a vector. You’re really pointing it in a direction, putting it on a vector. Now you continue to build on that off in that direction. There are a lot of things in there. There’s some features that I would have liked to have seen get in there probably day one, but that’s okay.\\n\\n One of the fascinating things about building it in the first place is with all the change traffic the front office recognized that maybe it was time to do something. They told a few of us that, “Okay, if you had a clean sheet of paper how would you do the Control Center?” Clean sheet exercise.\\n\\n We all head out for a week. I say all. It was four or five of us head out for a week in an office up there. I remember telling them. I said, “Well, we’ll ask for everything. They’ll give us about 50 percent. We got to be willing to accept about half of what we’re asking for.” That’s the way it usually is. So, we put everything in it that we wanted, and they gave it to us all. They told us, “Just go for it.” The front office very much supported our desire to make wholesale changes to the way the thing was put together and move it in a significantly different direction than where it was set to go.\\n\\n You really can’t ask for better than that. Most of it got in there, even though there were certainly some things that absolutely had to happen, other things could be put off and it wouldn’t hurt. But everything that had to happen is in there, and a lot of the things that didn’t have to happen right now are also in there. It’s difficult to figure out exactly how you measure the success or failure of one of these things. But I’d declare it a success."

Whenever I was young, I saw the movie Dirty Dancing and Baby's character talked about joining the Peace Corps. And I asked my mom, what is the Peace Corps? I was pretty young, I think, whenever it came out. And so she told me about it. And I was interested and in college, there was a recruiter that came and talked to us, but I'd already accepted a job for after college, so I decided to go ahead and postpone that dream. And then I was flying and I was flight attendant for American Airlines. They declared bankruptcy in 2012. So I decided to take a voluntary furlough and try to join the Peace Corps. And it was just perfect timing. My apartment lease was up and my car was paid off and I'd wanted to do it for so long. And so I just decided to go."

So, uh, and then we like language, the cultural type stuff, we had like dance classes. We had one Saturday where we just got to make all kinds of Georgian food. And that was really fun. One where we did like dance classes, because dance is a huge part of their culture as well.\n\nEach region of Georgia, it's a very small country, but each region is very proud and very distinct.

And originally I was slightly disappointed in where I was placed because Georgia is an amazing, beautiful country with mountains everywhere, and Khashuri is basically in the middle of the country with not many mountains around. And I just knew Khashuri and I was like, why did I get placed here? I thought it was not the best thing in the world in the beginning, but luckily a few of my friends helped me see. They were like, of course they put you there, Melissa, because Khashuri was where the next training would be and they wanted to put someone there. Well, I don't know that this is true. This is what people have said. That would be able to make good contacts and good relationships, and that way there would be more families that would want to host.\n\nAnd it just turned out to be really lucky because everyone would always come back to her Khashuri or a village close to there, because that was where they had done their service, their pre-service training. And again, these families were so important and so special to us that everyone would always come back to visit their families. So I had visitors all the time, so and I was right in the middle of the country. So it was very easy to get to the capital. It was very easy to get to the Black Sea. It was very easy to get to the mountains. So it ended up being like a really great location, actually."

She was 15 years old, and she just wanted to be with her boyfriend, her husband now. And so she, in Georgia, if you want to get married, you just run away in the middle of the night. So that's what she did. So one night I woke up and I hear my family all crying in the living room. The living room was right outside of my room. And I mean, even my brother, who was 17 at the time, was crying, which for a 17 year old boy, pretty much anywhere I imagine, but definitely in Georgia that's very uncommon.\n\nAnd I was like, what happened? And they were like, Magda run away. She's gotten married and she's not our girl anymore. And his, the groom's family also came over to the house because when everyone finds out, everyone is like, I guess, devastated at first and, um, but once."

And that's where they have like their beans, their potatoes, like all of the plants that have huge, they need a huge amount of space. And so they share this with like their whole extended family and they usually have a home there. And so he had taken her to his village home to stay the night and that's basically getting married.

And if they're not interested in passing the exams or going to college, then they just don't come to school in general unless they want to see their friends every once in a while. So I just taught first through 11th the first year. And the second year I taught 12th just because the 11th graders, I loved them. And so I wanted to follow them to 12th as well.

There between classes it's chaos. People are running through the halls and there's little kids and big kids and nobody is at all worried about it. They have mandatories, which is like a police officer, to like make sure everything is running well, but they do nothing because it's normal. This chaos is complete normalcy to them. And you go into a classroom and everyone is screaming and hollering and that's normal. And so just getting used to like little things like that and not being just completely overwhelmed was time consuming or whatever to just try to get used to it.\n\nBut then, then there's other things to that. Respect for me as a teacher in the United States is to be like listening and to be attentive and to answer questions when asked. And their respect is to not speak and to, as soon as the teacher comes into the room, to bring her a chair to sit down. And I'm not used to that. I don't want to sit down whenever I'm teaching. I want to be moving around the classroom and talking. And the kids would feel, they're just not comfortable with that because they thought that I should be sitting down."

And to me that is just not what I want to do whenever I'm teaching in a classroom. So it's quite different, but I mean, obviously."

I think it was probably similar to how things were done here long ago, where it's a lot of just, um, talking in front of the class and, you know, they would repeat things, but they were not thinking on their own. They weren't. And so and obviously this is an English, this is the second language class. So it's not like maybe this was different in a different type of environment or a different type of setting, but there was not much interaction. There was only, the only interaction that the kids had with the teachers, for the most part, was just repeating things back to them, things that they had memorized. And that to me is not learning another language. I mean, that's great that you can say this whole spiel, like I learned the Gettysburg Address when I was in sixth grade, but that didn't really help me learn very much. I just was able to repeat it.\n\nAnd so for me, I wanted the kids to be able to have a dialog, to be able to talk to each other. And my counterparts were both amazing and they were super open to different ways of teaching."

And he was a great volunteer as well. But it's a very different type program than Peace Corps. And it's basically just having another person in the room that speaks English. And so like, you know, I'm sure that he had kind of like made some suggestions but they didn't have the same type of training that we did as Peace Corps volunteers. So they didn't have all these resources that we had which were so helpful. And I was also really lucky because I had had so much training, well, not really training, but just experience as a substitute teacher here. So I was able to bring different things that I had learned from teachers in the United States over there, which was great.\n\nAnd Peace Corps Georgia was such a small post then and it's grown a little bit, but I think it's still pretty similar, that we were able to share so many things as volunteers, as a group together. And like we had several conferences where our counterparts came with us and so we were able to share these things together, which was really nice to get ideas from other volunteers."

So I'm like, they're getting something out of this classroom, you know what I mean? So and out of me being here. But it was really great. I saw this one beautiful, like, well, there were several things, but there's one thing that made me the most proud was my counterpart. I had talked to her because this was now my second year and I had had, it was the sixth grade class, now the seventh grade class. And there were three boys that always were, like if they came to class, they were cutting up in class, they were not paying attention, they never did their homework, and they weren't really worried about it. And the first year, I think, you know, I was still observing so much and trying to get things implemented that we didn't really come up with a plan. My first counterpart. They switched the grade levels. So one of my counterparts was with them when they were in sixth grade, and the other counterpart was with them in seventh grade.\n\nBut Nino, the counterpart that was with them in seventh grade, I told her, I was like, you know, these guys like not last year, and this is only maybe their third or fourth year of having English classes mandatory in the school anyway. So they were very new to the English language and it had only been like since they were like second or third grade. So I was like, they don't have a basis at all. Like they can't build, they can't get ahead, they're not going to do their homework because, you know, they're, they don't feel comfortable, and no one's ever thought they could, so they don't feel like they should. And so she came up with this awesome idea to ask any of the kids that had their very first year of English books to bring those. And we would take turns and, you know, one of us would work with the kids that work a little bit higher and do what we were already planning to do in our lesson plan. And the other one would work with those three boys, and they started doing their homework.\n\nI mean, it wasn't obviously perfect and it don't mean like that by any means, but it was just neat to see them like react. Because that's the thing, as long as you give kids a chance, for the most part, they're going to want to do well. But if they see no hope or no light, then of course, like, how are they going to have any kind of confidence in themselves and want to do it right or want to try? So it was really neat."

So we worked directly with the English teachers and, you know, I guess like people think like the main reason that we were there was to teach English to the kids, but a lot of it was just to transfer our skills to those teachers. So it could still be, you know, going long after we were gone, or at least their desire to keep learning long after we were gone is still there, right? And to keep improving their teaching. And it was really cool too, because we would do different games and different things. And then I noticed, like other teachers from different subjects would come and be like, Melissa, we're playing this game. What do you think? We're going to do this. And they would. And it was so neat to see like, and maybe they were already coming up with these things on their own. Maybe they were from different trainings, because Georgia was really starting to take education seriously, a lot more serious than it had. I told you, like a lot of times people would go to these private tutors instead of actually coming to school, especially once they got older and in certain subjects. So it was just really neat to see all of that like in these like beginning phases start to come to fruition."

And Keti, the one that moved to the capital, is also, keeps doing trainings. In fact, one of the Peace Corps coordinators from whenever I was in PST, in the training, she does a lot of English TOTs, like teacher, training of the teachers. And she was recently, Keti, my counterpart, was recently in one. The day that I went and went to visit this school and then had a supra, a big meal with the teachers afterwards, Keti came in town. And she was like, I'm sorry I'm late. I was with Kvansah who was doing this TOT for us for English teaching. So I'm really happy that they're all still super active and super motivated.

And so then like I would visit them at least once a week and they would always make me open my care package. They want to see what all was in there. Brown sugar was something they didn't have in Georgia, so I would show them and they'd be like, what is this? So I'd make them cookies and bring them. And they were like, oh, we have to have this sugar in Georgia. And I'm like, yeah. So like, you know, I became friends with them, people at the bazaars, and at the.\n\nThere was also grocery stores like where you get bananas and things that we couldn't get from my family's yard because we didn't have bananas in Georgia.

So like we were able to keep in touch, but it was basically how I imagined the entire service would be, and how I imagined it before I left as well. So it didn't really bother me in the beginning because I figured that it would be very sparse, my communication back with home, but you know I would still like write my blogs. And whenever I did have like access to internet, I would post them or whatever, but, um, and then obviously talk with my family. My mom got a lot of phone cards and would call me with those, so it was nice.\n\nPeace Corps provided us with a cell phone, but if we wanted to call the United States, obviously we had to pay for that and it was really expensive. So that didn't happen very often. But usually if I even just called my mom and like hung up, she would call me back. So that way I didn't have to, I think it might have charged a tiny bit, but not very much. But then once I got to my permanent site, we had internet pretty much all the time, like it was.

And my friends convinced me not to because there were times when it was really hard. And I think being there, and there's such an importance of family. And I left when I was 33. I turned 34 when I was there and 35. And then I had my 36th birthday right when I left. And I thought, you know, like there was times when I would really question like the reason I was there and if I was making an impact. And I thought, I just need to go home and start having children, like what am I doing? And I'm so glad I didn't do. Not that I didn't want children or anything like that.\n\nBut I'm so glad I didn't leave because every single day that was there was important to the whole journey there. And the amount of relationships that I made, both with people in Georgia as well as like my other Peace Corps volunteers, our government issued friends.

And we didn't make a list, but we were just like vocalizing, I guess, a list of people that were in our cohort that we were like, you know, this guy is kind of weird. Like, I would have never been his friend in the United States. Not that I wouldn't have been his friend, but we would have probably seen on the street, said hello, maybe smiled, because that's what people do in Texas. They smile or whatever, even if we don't, whatever, care for you. But, um. But then we would have kept walking. We would have never had a chance, like really get to know that person. And it's so. I think I knew this before I left, but it's so eye opening and so, I don't. It makes you realize, well, number one, we were all going through such similar things, right? We're all far from home. We're all, even though all of our experiences were so different, we were all going through the same thing in the same country and like experiencing a lot of the same things.\n\nAnd we're getting to know each other on such a deep level that we wouldn't have given ourselves a chance to had we just, you know, met on the street here. And so I think that's a lot of it, you know, and just realizing that you can learn something from every person, even if you think in the beginning, what, this person's crazy or something like that, you know what I mean? There's just something, there's something unique about Peace Corps I think that really, and maybe it's just because you're so far from home and you're so homesick and you're so all of these things. And so many of you guys, even if you're not experiencing it the same day, you're experiencing it at some point. I remember they gave us this calendar, like a timeline, and it was like a chart of like the roller coaster of your emotions and like how you come in so high because you're like, I'm in a new country, everything is beautiful, blah, blah. And then like the honeymoon period kind of fades and you're like, whoa, I still have two more years. Like, and it was so weird.\n\nI kept that that poster or that page up in my room on the inside of my armoire, because I wanted to make sure I focused on it. And whenever I started feeling like one of these like low points, I would look and I was like, OK, that says that. This is why. This is because the honeymoon phase is over. This is because I'm at the mid-point of my service and I'm not sure I'm making an impact yet or whatever. So it was really interesting to me that they were able to like give us such good resources, but also explain so much of like these things you're going to feel."

And I don't know if this is in every post, but Peace Corps Georgia had free calling and messaging between any Peace Corps members. So if we needed to contact someone like in Peace Corps headquarters, or not headquarters, but Peace Corps Georgia, like any training or managers, any type of anything, we could call them for free as well as volunteers. So we had some hot ears at the end of the day sometimes because we would have that phone on for until it was dead, because we were talking a lot to our fellow volunteers though."

And one time a friend of mine who was the volunteer the next year. So my second year I had two people in my town and then a lot that were very close, like maybe 20 minutes away. One was in Kvishkheti, which was my training village. And Hannah, who was in Kvishkheti in my training village, she went to help across the country, probably about 3 hours away from where we lived. One of our fellow, her fellow cohorts with a summer camp. And while she was there, the grandmother, the host family let all of them stay there. All the people that were helping with the camp, stay with them.\n\nAnd the grandmother there was asking all of them like, oh, where are you living in Georgia? Where are you living in Georgia? She was very interested and Hannah told her, I'm in Kvishkheti, it's a village of Khashuri. And she said, Khashuri? She was like, do you know the American that makes cakes? And this lady had never met me and she lives like 3 hours away. But everybody knows everything in Georgia. It is a very, very close knit. And she was like, yes, I know the girl that makes cakes. That's Melissa. She's my friend. And she was like, oh, can you tell me about her cakes? And she wanted to know all about it."

Like, I don't even understand this word. And I think a lot of it is, in Georgia they have been through so much. There has been so many people like, you know, invade Georgia and take things from Georgia. Like when Russia was there, they wouldn't let them practice their faith even. And so I think people are extremely open and want to know everything about you and will give you anything they have.\n\nBut when they first meet you, it doesn't seem, whenever they first see you, I should say. Because I would walk down the street and I'm used to smiling at people whenever you see them. And I did learn that you can't do that with men because they will take that the wrong way. But with women, especially old women, I can't see like a bebia is what it's called in Georgian, like an old grandmother, and not smile at her on the street. And I remember like one time so clearly this lady, I smiled at her and I said hello. And she was like, I don't, I don't recognize you. Who are you? Where do I know you from? And I was like, oh, you don't know me. I'm from Texas. And she was like, from where? She was like, from America? And I'm like, yes, in the United States. And she's like, why are you smiling at me? And I was like, just because I thought you looked nice and that's what we do. And so I think that that probably was something.\n\nUm, I remember at my exit interview with the school, with my program manager, my director for my school, and my counterpart, they, uh. Asmat, which was my program manager and such an inspiration the whole time I was there, whenever we were leaving, she said, Melissa, I don't know if you really understood what just. She was like, I know your Georgian is really well, really great. She was like, but I don't think you understand what they just said. And I was like, I think I understood like the majority of it. And she was like, I asked what your impact was here and what they think that, you know, the greatest thing that you left here was. And she was like, they said that your manners were one of the best things, that you would always remind the kids to say please and to say thank you. And she was like, and that they do that now, they do it and it's just customary. And that, and she was like, a lot of times whenever I interview people, you know, they'll tell me like what they think I want to hear.\n\nAnd she was like, and then several years down the road, they'll come back and tell me, you know, Melissa really did this. But it takes a while for them to realize that just because once you're gone, they start seeing the things that you did. She was like, but for you to have made this impact and for them to recognize it before you even leave the country? She was like, I'm kind of nervous about the one that's coming in after you because I hope that, you know, but again, that girl was awesome as well and she did an amazing job and people love her just as much as they love me. So I don't know. It made me feel like really special."

I'm sorry, I get very distracted and all over the place. But I remember one day, three things happened. I talked to three women that I just, made my day. So I was walking to school and this grandmother, this bebia, comes outside and started rubbing my face and she was like, you're our girl, you're our girl. She was like, thank you so much for getting Luka so excited, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, which one is Luka? Because again, in Georgia, everyone has very similar names. There's 15 Lukas in first grade. So, you know, anyway, I didn't know which Luka this would be, but she was like, he's so excited about going to school, blah, blah, blah.\n\nAnd so I get to class and I tell him, you know, my counterpart, I was like, you know, like the orange house, the tall one on the left on the way to school, who lives there, which Luka? And she says, ah, Grigaleshpe. And I was like, OK, well, his mom, his grandma is so excited. And she was like, oh, that makes sense. Because for the Writer of the Week thing, he turned in like six entries. So like he had gotten really excited. And whenever I talked to Asmat that day, I had just like, she was just calling to check in. And she, I told her, you know, sometimes I get so discouraged because I think like, you know, this kid's not coming to class as much or this kid. But she was like, Melissa, you have to celebrate the small victories. You have to get excited about Luka writing these six Writer of the Week entries. And my mom, she said, Melissa, when I talked to her that night and I was telling her about my day. And she was like, think about it. She was like, that grandma is excited about Luka. She was like, Luka is going to want his kids to be excited. And Luka is going to want his grandkids to be. And it'll just obviously, like, keep going, right? And like, the importance of education will one day be there.\n\nYou can't change everything in one day, in one, two years, and ten years. Like it's just like a slow moving process, just like it was in the United States for everything to come where it is. And we're still not there, right? So it's all about like, you know, celebrating the small stuff. Which everyone says, but it's hard to do whenever you're there and you want so much to be able to make a bigger impact or whatever so.

I think that that started happening before I even left for Peace Corps, because as soon as I got Georgia, I posted it on Facebook and told all of my friends and everyone starts looking and like, oh my gosh, like this is Georgia and blah blah blah, and oh, and that's where wine is from and you know, all kinds of things like that. So there was that. And then obviously when I was there I was doing a blog and, I mean, it was for my friends and family. It wasn't like I was trying to become this like famous blog writer because I have way too many grammatical errors for that. But it was just nice to like keep people abreast of what was going on and share pictures with them and that kind of stuff. Like I said, the world is so much smaller. It was really cool to be able to share that. And obviously pictures and things through Facebook as well and Instagram and whatever. And then now in school I'm able to like share it."

And in fact, I like have like a little piece of paper that I basically just Xeroxed and I put it on red because Georgia's color, Georgia's color, the flag is red and white. But I write the whole alphabet for them and its English letter translation. And so they're able. One little girl was like writing all of her, all of her like diary entries, journal entries for school, in Georgian letters. But English words, but with Georgian letters. And that to me is really cool. And they like, they learn the word gaumarjos and. Or not gaumarjos. Gamarjoba, which is hello. Gaumarjos is cheers. I did not teach them that one, but yeah. So it's really neat.\n\nAnd I mean on the airplane as well. Like people will say, oh, you speak Spanish so well. I'm like, yeah, and they're like, that's so cool. You're bilingual. I'm like, actually, I speak more than two. And they're like, what other language? And so I'm able to share a little bit then as well. So it's nice. It's really nice."

        "utterance": "Presently, I live here in Milwaukee on the west side. I live in a small neighborhood. I have a small house. I'm hoping to make it a sustainable house. I work with a group called Transition Milwaukee, which is part of Transition International, a group started about five years ago in response to peak oil and climate change crises is coming together at the same time. So we're basically retooling ourselves, trying to live locally instead of this kind of anti-globalization and creating a local economy. More gardening. I work with something called Victory Garden Initiative, which is based over in Sherwood. We're working on all these initiatives trying to get models built up of how we can sustain ourselves when oil is too expensive and fossil fuels are polluting the atmosphere too much for us to use them anymore.\n\nMy family, I have three children. My oldest lives in St. Paul. She graduated from Macalester and is working there as an admissions counselor. She's getting married this fall. She's 30, and she's been going with this guy a long time. But she's getting married this fall. My young, my son, the middle child lives here in Milwaukee. He's an armed security guard. He's married a young woman and we have two grandchildren through him. And I have my youngest daughter just graduated from Rhode Island School of Design, and she's working as a freelance artist at this time. My spouse lives in St. Paul. I'm transgender, and so that has caused some challenges for our families, but we're keeping our family and just going on. I'm retired from MPS after 25 years of teaching this spring, so I'm now being a full-time volunteer."

        "utterance": "When I think back, this question kind of gets to me, you know, gets to why did you join the Peace Corps? I was a senior in the college. I was a political science major. I liked international relations. I had studied a lot about causes of different things are happening around the world. My freshman year of college was the year that John F. Kennedy was shot. That was the marking point of my generation, as 9/11 is perhaps the marking point of the generation coming up at this time. Peace Corps was something started through his efforts. The idea had been floated out by Hubert Humphrey before, I understand, but he made it a reality with Sargent Shriver. And I felt I wanted to do that.\n\nI was, had gone a long way from home to go to school. I grew up in northern Indiana. I went to a small school in Pennsylvania and so I'd kind of gone away from home and gotten used to be out and about, and I wanted to help in the world with my life and I wanted to have an adventure too. I think I've achieved those things in the Peace Corps. And my family, my mom was always involved in do-gooder things. My dad was a bit reticent. He didn't believe much in church and government and politics. He didn't think much of it. You know, all his life he kind of was on the edge of supporting and not supporting all those kinds of things.\n\nBut my mom was always contributing here and there, and she was League of Women Voters, and she was American Association of University Women, AAUW, and she was involved in many, many things. So I think there's kind of an impetus there of getting involved, in doing something with your life."

I think I was probably sent to Ethiopia because of their alphabet. I don't know. I took two years of, actually three years of Russian in college, so I think probably they weren't going to send me to Russia. But dealing with that alphabet and dealing with a difficult language, I think probably that's a possibility why Ethiopia was selected for me. And I was quite willing to go there. I was glad to. I'm very grateful for my experience on the African continent."

And probably February or March of that year, I heard where I was going to go and I sent back that, yes, I would accept that placement. So they told me I'd be going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for my training. So I told my family and they planned a trip out West. I went to parks, Yosemite, we visited Yosemite, and then they dropped down to Utah and dropped me off, and then they went on to the West Coast. And that was the summer trip that they had. My oldest brother was living out on the West Coast, so I think, you know. That's how it kind of all worked out."

But because of my kind of reticence to be out there, people made friends with me and I accepted their friendship, but I didn't really hang out with the guy as much or do things. So I didn't have a lot of close friends who would be asking me personal questions. They just said, oh yeah, he's going off to the Peace Corps. So off I went. There wasn't any. And at home, they were, you know, they were, you know, some concern about me going off far away, but not really. They were just glad that I had a mission and a goal and some place that I wanted to do, something that I wanted to do."

And I bought a pair of postal shoes, postmen's shoes. There was a place, I think it was maybe like a Army-Navy surplus store they recommend we go to. So I did some shopping there.

They scraped off the topsoil, planted these tents there. It was across the street from a school. They bussed in Native American children from the reservation, and they were guinea pigs for TESL. So we had three to four weeks at least, it might have been six, but I think it was three to four weeks of training in this place in the desert. But the rest of it was back in Salt Lake City at a university, so it was sort of semi in-country training. His best attempt at in-country training, which was the director's vision of how challenging Ethiopia would be."

Some of that was linked with language studies. Some of it was a kind of a separate kind of a thing. But we spent a lot of time in terms of trying to understand the culture and trying to figure out how we would actually interact in that culture. And then the language is the language, you know, how you need to do some, how you get to the marketplace and how you do all the different things that you need to do in order to live a daily life. And then there was the regular TESL, you know, teaching us how to be TESL teachers. So that's not something that I had done before, but it was. We had those different kinds of classes, and everybody knew their stuff very well, and I think they did a really good job of getting us."

I mentioned earlier on the tape that I was kind of a quiet introvert kind of a person, not too many people really had a lot of remarks about my going to Ethiopia from my college. They just said, oh yeah, well, good luck. Have fun. There wasn't a lot of real strong personal friendships. That carried through into my Peace Corps training too. And again, a couple of people befriended me and they came to me when we were in this place in the desert. They said, you know, there was a, it was actually a slaughterhouse building. It was a concrete block building. It had two rooms with all these meat hooks hanging in it. And that was the hangout kind of place. They would go there and play music and dance and, you know, on weekends and they would hang out there because there was no town nearby to go to them and hang out, no downtown or anything.\n\nSo the kind of the social crew would go there and hang out. And basically word got around to me through these two friends who kind of befriended me that I needed to go. Otherwise, I wasn't going to Ethiopia. Basically, that was how it was what you know here. They would, they took a couple of weekend trips up to the mountains and stuff like that. I stayed back in my tent and studied my language because I wanted to go to Ethiopia. So I was studying and studying my language, so because I could get. But they also said, well, you need to be able to know that you can."

A lot of, um, the principal of the school and some of the other main staff were Amharas. And there were many Indian teachers there. Many teachers came over from India because the salary was good and they could get money and then send it back home. And I think this is probably true. Apparently they said, because India has a surplus of educated people, this happens a lot in countries around the rim of Africa, of India. They send teachers all over. So there were a lot of Indian teachers there.\n\nAnd there were a lot of. We had four Peace Corps volunteers in the same town that year. That was the last year they had individual volunteers. Next year, they sent two married couples there, because it was kind of, they decided it was a kind of a hardship post. So the second year I went to. That town, the only way of access, there's no road. You have to fly in. And for four months, five months of the year, it was too wet to land. It was a grass airport. It was too wet to land.

We could listen to his radio and listen to music and tapes, and he played guitar.

A white horse with all the fancy livery on it. You know, he was a very diminutive man, but he came and sat under a dais and they had the celebration and a bonfire they lit. And whichever way the fire fell was supposed to say whether it was a good harvest or a bad harvest. So it was kind of like, but it was on the celebration of the finding of the True Cross, which is a Coptic, very strong Coptic. So it was kind of a mixture of their traditions, the old tradition of the harvest festival and the Coptic mixed together.\n\nYeah. He was still strong. He was there. It was about two or three years, maybe four years after I left that the overthrow came. And it was as gently done as they can be done, I guess. He was just put in the, you know, kind of quiet retirement. His children, they're a little less well I think. I don't think anybody was really killed or murdered, but they were definitely put out of power. He tried to create a civil system that would survive him, but he started too late or didn't push hard enough. The landlords or landowners were too strong to push against. It didn't quite make it so that a Democratic elected or at least an elected kind of government, whether it be democratic or not. It turned out to be more kind of an oligarchy. He was kind of setting up more of an oligarchy that could have come along, but it didn't really happen. Just didn't quite get the. He had a lot of fancy buildings to try to make it go. But the energy wasn't there. The energy was still with the more feudal system which then led itself to be the stronger."

So I'd make my breakfast.\n\nThe Peace Corps staff was, you know, and we had a local regional guy who was in charge of us, Andy, and he was good, he was fine. He was kind of always trying to figure out how he can help us. So I said, I like peanut butter. So he went to the store in Addis, the store in Addis, and had me shipped, before while things are still shippable, he shipped me a case of peanut butter. The difficulty was, it was natural peanut butter. Hadn't been homogenized and everything else. So it was fairly rancid when it came to me. So I had a case full of rancid peanut butter that I couldn't really. I tried to eat it now and then, but mostly I ate local food. My students would go get me a chicken like once a month or so and have chicken. And they knew how to chop its head off and put it under the pan while it flopped, and then they would clean it up and we would have chicken.\n\nI didn't do too much with beef and stuff like that. I think they got some. I gave them like an allowance for their food and stuff like that. So we had a good life. I mean, I'd go to school. [tape break] I think I had three classes, maybe four classes, I can't remember, of like seventh grade students, teaching TESL. So we would meet at our appointed times during the day. The main high school had a big building all connected and then I was, my classroom was in kind of a separate building. There were four classrooms and I think two opened on one side and two. It was, I think the regular building was a frame building. I think this was either concrete or block. I don't remember at this point whether it was a formed, a cement building. I think it was cement block. I don't know if it was really block or if it was built out of stone, but it was not frame construction. It was some kind of heavy construction, block or concrete or something.\n\nSo, you know, it had good windows. We had, you know, the children had desks, you know, tables, that they worked at. Chalkboards and chalk. So and they had copy books. We used the kind of books we took tests on in college, that's what they used for their regular classroom books. Most of the classes were taught by rote. The teacher would write something on the board and you would copy it down. And that was the class time. And very little talking about what was in the content of it. The physics classes were taught that way and all the science classes and everything was taught that way. And they went home and studied them. And then they would come back for the test and they would try to regurgitate it. So and then the TESL, of course, then we were, I was doing something different because we were actually. I would write sentences kind of like you would diagram sentences, with columns, and we would, you know.\n\nI read the book, five times. Or I went to the market. And then, you went to the market, and we do all the pronouns and we would, you know, separate all the different words and substitute words, and we would say it and verbalize it and, you know, they would have to write a sentence that was like that, that they made up. And so we did lots of. So it was more oral based on what they were used to. So it was a little more of a challenge for them, because they liked, they were used to what they liked, what they were used to, which was, you give me something, I write it down and I give it back to you. That's what they liked. So sometimes it was a little challenge because there was, in language there's flexibility, and they didn't really want that flexibility. They wanted the right thing. They wanted it right because they were going to get it right on the test because they wanted to pass their leaving exam and they wanted to go on, which was a very valid reason. However I was trying to do something a little different."

Two of the teachers taught, the volunteers, Peace Corps volunteers, taught high school. Two of us taught middle school. So I taught seventh grade, then there was eighth grade, and then there was the other teacher taught at the high school."

I went there for Thanksgiving dinner but that's about the only time I had contact with them. They were from the States someplace. But I was, then I taught third through eighth grade. They started English language instruction in third grade, but with the third grade I was only helping the teacher. And fourth and fifth and sixth, I was kind of team teaching with the teacher. There was a teacher assigned, a native teacher was assigned there, but I was just kind of helping them. And I was helping them, they were trying to introduce a program that had come out of England that had manipulatives. So I made up envelopes and we tried to help them to teach that way too. I don't know if it lasted after my year or not.\n\nAnd then I was teaching, I taught the seventh and eighth graders their language. There was one person who had been, he must I think he was about 30 years old, one man, and he was in my eighth grade class. And he had been a teacher at the mission school, but he hadn't really passed his eighth grade leaving exam yet. And they had told him that, he had a family, you know, he had a life. You know, he had to pass the eighth grade leaving exam that year or he wasn't going to be able to come back to their school and be a teacher. So, I never really heard how he did, because I had to leave before he got the results, and I came back to the States and I lost track of whether he ever passed. I've always wondered if he passed. I always hoped he did, He worked hard at it. So anyway, so the second year was a little different. And then also that year I was able to go into town. I'd take the bus into a town, that was not the capital city but a larger town, and visit volunteers. I only did that once."

Bring all the books back! Because they were just taking the books and, you know, they were free books. So they took them home. They never had a book in their own hand, in their own house before. So they were just taking the books and going home with them. So he said, bring the books back.

It wasn't really riding, you know, you'd just kind of walk the horse along, just to get the horse some exercise and me some practice riding the horse.

I took lots of pictures, I have color slides and black and white, and I very much. [phone rings] Excuse me while I answer this. [tape break] So I. We went on those trips a lot that year.\n\nThe second year I kind of went on some trips. I'd take a few students with me. There wasn't a group like those high school kids. You know, my second year they went up to eighth grade, so they weren't that much, weren't that free, I guess, from their families. But I would take a couple of kids along with me and we would go on hikes and I'd say, hey, where could we go? And so we would go off hiking this way or off that way, or this way or that way. And then on the weekends, so I got to see the country. I spent a lot of time at the marketplaces, just shopping and just looking around. I took a lot of pictures of the marketplaces. It was just fascinating. The Gallinia people were there and there were subgroups of the Gallinia.

They said that you shouldn't do that, but we always did anyway, gave a letter of recommendation so that they'll be able to continue that. And I was just, um. The year we left, in between the two years, that fall was a big turmoil among students all over Ethiopia. So I guess the high school that I was teaching at before, the school was shut down for several months from student unrest. And apparently some of the Peace Corps volunteers' students, who had worked with Peace Corps, were kind of the ringleaders of all of this. So I got some more feedback on some of the difficulties some of those students have and so it made it a little different.\n\nBut, you know, I just, they were living their lives the best they could. There was a lot of joy in their people. They didn't have much. They made ends meet with what they had. They didn't waste stuff like they do everywhere else. Coming back here was, oh, it was a shock. There if you had a glass bottle, it was a glass bottle that you had forever. Here, it was something to get thrown in the street and bust up. Plastic wasn't much around back then. So we didn't have plastic bottles. The few glass bottles that came to town stayed in town and were used and reused. All those kinds of things sit with me a lot in terms of how I've lived my life since. And what's important and what's not so important, it makes a lot of difference from my experience there. Living that life for those two years and living it as simply as I could and trying to continue to live as simply as I could when I got back to the States."

So I went to see there, those rock churches. That's where I eventually came across my career, because I'd met some people from California whose daughter was taken Montessori training, and they told me about Montessori training. So eventually, when I got back to the States after a few false starts doing some other things, I worked in Montessori training, which became my career eventually.\n\nBut then in the first summer, those guys that befriended me in my training wanted to go to Kenya and so we went to Kenya and Uganda. We flew down to Nairobi, and then we took the train to Mombasa, which is on the Indian Ocean. And we stayed a week there on some hotels on the beach in Mombasa. And then we took the train back across to Kampala, Uganda, and we went up to a game park up there and saw, uh. I'm trying to get the name of the falls. We didn't get to see Victoria Falls because Victoria Falls is right down. We saw a falls and we stayed in a game park, and it was very fun. And on the way back, we found out that we could take taxis from town to town instead of taking the train. So all the way back from Uganda, Kampala, Uganda to Nairobi, we took a taxi from town to town."

But the train ride was really cool too, because we went across the Rift Valley. That was so powerful to see the Rift Valley because we were just going along the edge of it. And you could see like the edge was straight down and you know, 50, 60, 100 miles across. You can see the other edge and you can see the Earth that had just gone, whoosh. This great Rift Valley. And so it was kind of cool to go just along the edge and see it from that perspective. So I remember that."

It rained a lot and you had to wear these boots and you had to. The mud was muddy and just the mud stuck to your boots. You didn't walk through, you globbed through, you know, and it was day after day after day. It was a little challenging, but we made it. And it was, we made ourselves happy through it."

And so we came to this pool of water and it was so inviting. So a couple of us went swimming in there. And so we were having a great time swimming. So we got our clothes on, went back up higher, and then up higher were all these cows all doing their droppings in the stream. And then the mineral water was actually coming out of a rock at high level. So you put, we had bottles with us so we would collect the mineral water at the top. But the water we were swimming in was, you know, basically had been cow water."

It's a snail that would get in your system and cause havoc. So I think we're above the bilharzia, I think that's how you say it, elevation. I always wondered. So far it hasn't shown up. But anyway, how did.\n\nYou know, looking back over that time, I felt I gained a ton for my life from my experience there. I hope I gave a fraction of the gifts that I received to the people that I worked with. As I said, I always remembered about that eighth grade student. I wondered if he ever passed. I wondered about different students, you know, I have their pictures and I remember some things about them now and again. And I wonder if I made a difference in their lives or not. They were locked into a system that was a leaving exam system. Things got pretty rough after a few years after Haile Selassie was deposed and there was a lot of rough times.

Martin Luther King had been assassinated. I wanted to come back and see what my country was again and see what was going on because I didn't understand what was going on. I hadn't really been a part of the civil rights movement at the beginning. I mean, I could have been, you know, my summers could have been in the South organizing voter rights and stuff like that when I was in college, but I was in a whole different place. And when I came back from the Peace Corps, I wanted to see what was going on. I was in the home, I was past that place, and my life has still been pretty traditional and pretty set, but I did choose a field of education that's, um.\n\nWhen I came back to the States, I started with a secondary education and social studies program in Philadelphia. And there were several of us in the program. This other fellow and I was assigned to an agricultural high school on the edge of the city. It's an agricultural high school that was supposed to be like a training ground for high school students from the inner city to get training to be, like really hands-on training, to do animal care, small animal care for lab animals, and to be able to work for parks departments and things like that. So it was kind of an agricultural high school. But they wanted to change it into a regular academic prep school because the people who are going there were the, pardon me everybody, the smart black kids and the not so smart Jewish kids who couldn't make it in the regular system. And the black kids wanted out of the inner city, their parents wanted them to have. So they wanted accreditation. And this other guy and I, I had been coming from Ethiopia where I had to teach that curriculum. I was experimenting and doing weird things. And we got kicked out of our school.\n\nSo basically, I wanted to do something that wasn't traditional education. So eventually I found Montessori education, which became a way to do education that was not so traditional, that was hands-on, that involved the children in the learning. That was more of what I wanted to do with my life than just be a traditional teacher. So I think it formed me a lot in what I want to do with my life. It was a bit of a struggle finding that, but I stuck with it then for 25 years here and 30 years altogether in teaching Montessori."

I had some artifacts, baskets and basketry that was made in Ethiopia, and I would put on my gabi. I have a piece of apparel, clothing, that would be used, worn by somebody in Ethiopia, so I could show them how to use that and talk about the culture and different things like that and show the pictures and tell them about the work that I did over there.\n\nSo I feel like I spread the word about other countries, especially Ethiopia as a country that I had been in.

We didn't have a TV all the time our children were growing up, and we only had one car. There was one time we had two cars, we had a truck and a car. But pretty much we have, you know, small fuel saving cars, Toyotas. We lived as simply as we could. And we tried to raise our children as simply as we could and not consume and use more than we really needed. So I think all in all, it made a very big impression on myself and on the family that I've got now.\n\nNot necessarily that they will follow the path that we, our generation spoke about, not that they will follow necessarily all the things that we did, but we had a good time growing up. There were challenges, of course, but it was a good time, having our family. I'm very grateful to the Peace Corps experience that I had, and just hopeful that it was good for the people I served."

The rest of the world would be in a different place, and so would we. Volunteerism catches on, and it has caught on, and there's some of it going on.

Because we just, we have had so many chances. You know, we had the '60s, we had the '70s. We had a little bit of the '80s and then we really shut down. It's been a really long shutdown. Things are starting to open up a little bit now, I hope. But I think we're seeing, a lot of people don't realize how much change is necessary because we've let it go so long. There's a lot of change that's necessary right now. And it's just, it's going to be overwhelming to us unless we're going to start making some steps to go forward.

      "description": "Jed Meline served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Micronesia from 1990 to 1992 as an English teacher. He was stationed on a remote island in Chuuk state (also called Truk). He discusses his work as an elementary school English teacher preparing students to take the high school admittance exam, and his work as a public health worker. He tells stories about helping save a baby's life by providing rehydration medicine and helping families get funding for water catchment tanks during a particularly severe drought. Meline discusses violence on the island and being protected from this violence by the clan-based support system. He also talks about the impact of the Peace Corps on his life, the view of Americans in other countries, and the role of the Peace Corps as the training ground for foreign aid workers in USAID and more broadly.

Um, so then I started doing more public health interventions, talking about nutrition, talking about, um, uh, clean water and washing your hands and that sort of stuff.\n\nHad a couple of opportunities in that one was my host mom was pregnant when I was, about the time I got there she got pregnant. And, um, you know, when you're the visitor, people would give me a papaya or a fish or any, you know, gift. And I'd say, this is for the pregnant woman back home. I'm going to give this to the pregnant woman back home. Um, good, you know, this is good food for the, for a pregnant woman to eat. Um, and she had one of the biggest babies they'd ever seen. I mean, nutrition probably helped, but, um, but people saw the connection, for whatever it was worth, you know? Um, because I. But at my point was to express this is good food. It turned out she had a very big, healthy baby, which helped."

        "utterance": "Um, uh, also in the end of my second year there was a drought, uh, which is a, a bigger, a very serious concern on a tiny island. Um, the wells started running dry and it turned out there were very few water sources, fresh water sources that would continue. Um, it meant laundry couldn't be done, had to be done in the ocean, which isn't very effective if you've ever tried to wash clothes in salt water. Because they just didn't have enough water for drinking and cooking, um, but each, each island got a grant every year to do some sort of, uh, work, um, improvement. And every year they just bought more fishing boats. So they were fishing boats scattered all over with motors with no gas to run them. Uh, every family had one, two, or three of these boats, and if they got another grant they were going to buy some more boats.\n\nBut because of the drought, I worked to try and design a water catchment tank. And so I worked. It was, it was kind of clever, but so I got a design for water catchment tank, but there wasn't enough money in the grant for every family to get one. And so I scaled it down from a thousand gallons, which was the standard in the, in the country, down to about 700 gallons. But that would allow every family to get one. Then whenever anybody was going into the capital, I'd ask them, can you get a price for the cement? Can you get a price for this rebar? Can you get a price for me? So that I'm putting together this proposal, I'd have the people go get the prices for me. So they began to get invested in the project.\n\nAnd so, and at the height of the drought, I, you know, I said, I have an idea for how to use your grant if you'd like. It's to build every family a water catchment tank, even if you have one, you can have another one, or repair, repair the one you have if it's broken. Um, and here's, here's my ideas. You know, and they passed it around and discussed it. In the end, they agreed to go forward with the water catchment idea, tank idea. So we submitted that to the state for the grant for the, for the island. They approved it. And um, and so the supply started coming. No tank was finished by the time I left, but each family had received a grant, had received, the island had received a grant, and each family had received their allotment of supplies to be picked up and brought back to the island to build a catchment tank."

So I'm hoping that helped, because even when there isn't a drought, a catchment tank is a much cleaner, better source of water than the, the well and the pipe that they used, which generally was contaminated, uh, for drinking at any rate. That was fine for washing dishes and doing clothes, but um, wasn't safe for drinking in a catchment."

Um, and they have, because it was, they were, the U.S. blockaded it. So there was no food for the 50,000 Japanese soldiers that were there. So it was the Japanese soldiers were beginning to starve. They were very, very abusive to the Chuukese. Um, killed them and ate them, really horrible stories.

They had a specific way of carving canoe paddles with a very funny tip, um, because you're, there was, culturally you're not supposed to push with the paddle. You have a pole. So if you're on a low, you know, you could push out to get into the ocean, but you can't push with your paddle. So they carve their paddles with a funny point, which would break off if you pushed, um, and they had a special wood you would use to carve canoe paddles. There were almost no canoes left.

In my view, the U.S. horribly mistreated Micronesia for 40 years following World War II. There's no reason why people would be, should be dying of diarrheal disease.

This is, whatever, 20 years after World War II. The Brown Report, it was called. And outlined all the horrible ways in which the U.S. was not doing right by the Micronesians. Thirty years later, the report is completely accurate. Um, so when they were getting their independence, part of me was like, yay! Now you can establish more for yourselves. Um, you can get aid from the Japanese. You can get aid from other countries that would give aid to a poor country like this, which wasn't allowed as a U.S. territory. Japan's not going to give aid to a U.S. territory.\n\nAnd now they get aid from the Germans because the Germans were the first ones to live there. And then the Japanese have long ties to, to Micronesia as well. Um, and they continue to get the grant money from the U.S. for the basing rights. So it was a win-win for them in many respects. I don't think it ever made up for the wrongs the U.S. committed to them all those years. The analogies to the American Indian are one-for-one in so many ways like that. The alcoholism, the cultural mismatch, a lot of them are very parallel to many of the American Indian tribes that Americans might be familiar with.\n\nUm, so it was bittersweet for me. I was very happy for them. They were actually kind of sad until they realized that all the benefits they were getting would continue under the, the, the trust. There was a name for the new agreement. Um, so they were actually, they were also torn in a different way because they, they liked being part of America even though it brought them nothing but pain. Um, uh, so it was, it was a, it was a weird time and on the ground very little changed, obviously. Um."

Um, you know, they had to open an embassy here in Washington. Um, now, I think the grant, the amount of money the U.S. government support provides has been dropping in stages since then, um, probably to the great detriment of Micronesia, I imagine. But, um, at the time it didn't. There was no tangible difference other than they had a vote in the United Nations.\n\nAnd, I mean, even then they issued their own passports. So they, that must have been happening for some time up, even though it was a U.S. territory they had their own passports. Unlike Guam, which is part of the United States proper.

And I'm like, well, why do the Peace Corps volunteer? But I went and it was the middle of the night. You got your lantern, it's pouring rain. You go in and there's a little hut and there's a very sick little baby. And you know, my heart breaks. Like we couldn't even get in the boat because the water was too rough. There's no way we'd even get to the hospital, not that there was care at the hospital that would make a difference either. Um, so I did what every Peace Corps does, I brought my ORS packets and said, mix this up. And we made some. And feed it to your baby. It says for every water they lose, you know, you need water to live, and as you lose water, you get sicker and sicker.\n\nUm, so we made some and I left the packets and, uh, we gave her some fuel to be able to boil more water. And, and I went with my host mom, you know, visit a young woman in the middle of the night wouldn't happen, but, um. And I went home and I was like, you know, I don't know where that baby's going to be, you know. Next morning, the baby had survived, and a day later, they said the baby was doing better. And I was just glad, you know, just frankly totally relieved. Um, and then like a week and a half later, I was walking back from my little shower in the bush and passed the women who were doing laundry. And I heard the young mom telling the other moms how this ORS solution had saved her baby."

And I'm just taking pictures with my camera because I'm not going to be able to spear a fish to save my life. Um, and I'm swimming around snorkeling, and I look and I'm like, oh, there's a shark. So I look around and the other guys are still fishing. So I'm like, okay, it must be okay. Shark goes away. Ten minutes later, there are two sharks. Big sharks. All right, look around there. Guys are still fishing. It's okay. All right, I'm doing good.\n\nCome up, I turn, there are four sharks. And I stick my head out of the water and all the guys are up on the shore. I'm like? And they're like, don't you see the shark? I'm like, yeah! Why didn't you tell me? And I get scrambling out of the water and get out of the shark. Like, so much for following what the locals do.

But they'd get dynamite, and if you throw dynamite in the ocean and it explodes, well, it knocks out all the fish. The fish all float to the surface. It kills the reef and kills all the little baby fish and kills lots of other things too. It's very harmful. It also tells every shark within a thousand miles that there's a lot of dead fish over there. Come. And so the guys go in the water trying to gather all the dead fish, and the sharks are feeding. Those are the guys that get bitten by the sharks. Almost never does a."

        "utterance": "The project was going for a couple months with a very limited crew on it, probably three, four, maybe five people here at the Hazy Center, and I was out at the [Paul E.] Garber [Preservation, Restoration, and Storage] Facility. Since I’m the person that does a lot of the ordering on the paints and supplies, I was in constant contact with Ed [Edward M.] Mautner. He was the lead on the project, and I was hearing that they felt kind of overwhelmed. They had a lot of work to do, they had a limited timeframe to get it done, and it just didn’t seem like they had the manpower available.\\n\\n I approached my supervisor and volunteered to go onto the project because I felt like I could probably make a difference. He was a little bit surprised, actually. It was obvious that he didn’t consider me as a person he was going to put on the project, but he was glad to accept and sent me out to work on the project. I think that the crew out here was pretty happy to have one additional person. Even though it probably still wasn’t enough people, they were happy just to have a few more hands out here.\\n\\n At that point, they were still in the process of cleaning the exterior. They had already started the prep work on the side walls and had experimented a little bit on the cargo bay doors but hadn’t gotten too far there. In the months leading up to that, I had heard that they were having a lot of problems getting a consistent finish on the side walls with the methods that they were using. I’d send them out various grits of sandpaper, and I kept hearing back that they weren’t making much progress. I really didn’t understand what the problem was, but it became obvious the first day that I went up and started trying to do some sanding on the side walls.\\n\\n Thinking that it was a space artifact, I thought it would have a polyurethane or some sort of aerospace coating, but what we failed to take into account was that prior to being given to the Smithsonian, it was at the World’s Fair [1984 Louisiana World Exposition], and apparently they had done a spruce-up on it to make it look better. They had painted a lot of the exterior surfaces, the side walls and the upper doors, with latex paint. We found that in some areas there was actually five layers of latex paint, and it just doesn’t sand anything like an aerospace-type coating.\\n\\n Here I was sending all these fairly fine grits, and they really weren’t even putting a dent into the surface that needed to be prepped. We went from a 400-grit paper down to eventually having us start with an 80-grit paper, which is a very aggressive grit that you would probably never consider using on something like this, and then we’d step up eventually to 180- and 220-grit paper to finish it out with.\\n\\n I probably worked for the first three weeks to a month on just sanding the side walls. We were using a random orbital sander. Myself, Ed, and Tony [Anthony W. Carp] took turns. We had a special setup that really only allowed two sanders to work at the same time. It had a special dust collection system, and it had a limited run of hose, so we had to work side-by-side. Early on, it was primarily Tony Carp and myself that were side-by-side on the side walls.\\n\\n It was interesting because we’d get into sort of a groove. It was almost like one person didn’t want to stop first to take a break, so we were seeing who could outdo the other person, who would be the first one to actually take a break. We’d sit there sanding, and I’d see him kind of looking at me, and I could tell he wanted to take a break but he didn’t want to be the first one to stop, and I’d keep going. We kept pushing each other, and as a result of that I think we probably covered a lot more ground than we normally would have if we were working individually. The fact that we were side-by-side kind of made us push each other.\\n\\n And it was fun. The project as a whole was pretty demanding physically, and I think it was one of the reasons why some of the other folks in the shop probably weren’t enthusiastic to volunteer. Thinking about the overall project and what it meant, it was something that I felt like I wanted to get involved in. I wanted to be part of it because I saw it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and it’s something that we could be proud of in years to come and something that we’d talk about a lot, and we do.\\n\\n There’s not too many people that can say that they painted a Space Shuttle. Sometimes you get in conversations and people ask you what do you do for a living, and you start telling them, “Well, you know, we painted the Space Shuttle,” and you get that funny look like, “Is this guy pulling my leg, or is this for real?”"

Hopefully in the near future we’ll shift into full-up restorations again.\\n\\n Aside from that, I’d worked on the [Stinson] L-5 [Sentinel aircraft], we did an overall paint job on that. I’d done some work on the Dornier Do 335 [Pfeil aircraft], some paint work on the [Curtiss] P-40 [Warhawk aircraft] that’s hanging out in the museum. Also the Heinkel [He] 219 [Uhu aircraft] fuselage, which has this interrupter pattern, camouflage on it. That was an interesting project that I worked on, and did most of the painting on that. Ed Mautner and myself did the camouflage on the top of it. He took one side and I took the other, and it was another interesting and fun project."

        "utterance": "Oh, boy. It took months and months of work. The side walls were probably the easiest because they were mostly flat and it was all done with a random orbital sander, which wasn’t too bad, but when we got to the cargo bay doors, that was the real challenge. Part of the stipulation we had was that they were still considered flightworthy spares, so we had limitations on what sort of abrasive we could use or the type of equipment we could use on it.\\n\\n Early on we were told we couldn’t put any weight on the doors, we couldn’t walk on the doors. Somewhere down the line in the initial processes of doing the stripping, we found that we couldn’t get past actually getting out and standing on the doors. There was no way we could do it. Leaning over the scaffold and the odd position that it would put you in, it was just physically impossible.\\n\\n We had that discussion among us on the team, and we still weren’t sure if we could get around it. Then a couple days later it got to the point where I realized I just can’t do this, I can’t get to these areas. I think I was the first person that stepped down on the doors and squatted down and started scraping. About 10 or 15 minutes later I heard this, “Hey, you’re on the doors. What are you doing on there? I thought you couldn’t do that.” I said, “Well, I’m doing it. I don’t see how we can get around it.” And then slowly after that everybody followed suit because they realized that was so much easier than what we had been doing. We kept it spread out, we tried not to concentrate the load in any one area.\\n\\n The stripping of the paint on the doors was all done with a heat gun and a putty knife. Somebody within our group came up with the idea. I think it might have been Steve Kautner, who’s moved on to another job. We found that was really the only effective method, to use a heat gun and then work a small area and scrape it with a putty knife. It was really time-consuming, and it was really hard on our hands.\\n\\n One of the biggest problems I saw with the whole project was that short-term it had really wrecked my hands, and a lot of people were having the same problem. It continued for almost a year and a half after that project was done. I was really concerned that it was carpal tunnel [syndrome] and that it was going to be a constant thing I was going to have to deal with, but slowly but surely it subsided. Then after a year and a half or so, my hands feel like they’re back to normal. It was tough sitting there scraping all day long for eight hours a day. We’d try to switch the putty knife back and forth from hand to hand, but that only gave a little bit of relief.\\n\\n The whole process was tedious, and it was tough because the skin was such a thin layer of aluminum over a composite, that if you concentrated the heat in any one area for too long it would actually blister the top skin. We did do that in quite a few areas before we got the hang of it. In a very short period of time we got the method down. It took each person a little bit longer, depending on the way each person worked, but we very quickly kind of got the hang of it and were able to move through it without doing any damage to anything."

        "utterance": "I did have some discussions with some of the folks at [NASA] Kennedy [Space Center, Florida]. I got the original spec [specification] on the paint, which was a urethane paint, and got the original color. It was actually a variation of Insignia White. From there I concluded that a comparable paint, a polyurethane, would be the way to go. We’ve had a longstanding relationship with PPG [Industries] paints here at the Smithsonian, and in the past they’ve given us a lot of support and donated materials.\\n\\n I started contacting the people that I knew at PPG, and found out that PPG had recently acquired PRC–DeSoto, which is an aerospace military coatings company. It was an area they were a little light on in their product line. PPG more concentrated on automotive paints, but they had taken over the PRC–DeSoto line to give them the market for military coatings. My contact here in PPG put me in touch with a rep [representative] out on the West Coast.\\n\\n His name was Duane Utter, and he was one of the managers for military coatings and specialty coatings. In discussions with him I was trying to figure out how we were actually going to apply the paint. We knew we had to do it in the museum because the Shuttle was already here, and I didn’t think there was any way with the square footage that we had to cover that we could actually do it by spraying. There’d be too much overspray, too much fumes that we wouldn’t be able to exhaust, so I was looking for some sort of alternative way that we could do it.\\n\\n When I got in touch with Duane, he mentioned that on large airliners they had a specialty product, a flow additive that they add to the paint. It actually allows you to roll the paint on with a low-nap foam roller. I’d never heard of such a thing. It was kind of intriguing, but I was skeptical at first because all my expertise had been in spraying. I’d never had really much experience with rolling paint except for house paint. I never would have thought that you could have rolled a polyurethane or an aerospace paint.\\n\\n My initial thought was it seemed like a ridiculous idea, but the more that I looked into it—he sent me some tech [technical] sheets on it and some shots of some guys rolling an airliner out on a pad somewhere—and I thought, you know, maybe there’s some merit in this. This actually looks like it might be the perfect solution for what we’re doing. Obviously you’d get some vapors coming off, but you have no actual overspray, and there’d be a lot less hazards to work with than trying to spray it.\\n\\n So we talked it through, and he decided that he would offer some samples for us to try. He sent me out a gallon of white paint, a gallon of the roll additive, and the reducers and hardeners and all that went into the paint. I set off at Garber doing some test panels, trying to figure out how this stuff would work.\\n\\n There was certain ratios to mix the hardener and the paint and the reducer in, and then you had a range of options on the flow additive, different amounts to give you different flow characteristics. I just started experimenting with different amounts. My main concern was on the side walls. Being that it was a vertical surface, I knew that was where it was going to run the most.\\n\\n I did all my test panels vertically because I knew if I got it to work well vertically that the sections of the door, which curve up from almost vertical to almost horizontal, wouldn’t be a problem. I found that the ratio that worked the best was about six ounces of roll additive to a mixed gallon of paint. That was what we ended up going with, and no reducer for the whole mix. We found that the roll additive actually acted as a reducer, and that the reducer that they recommended wasn’t needed at all."

        "utterance": "Yes. One of Duane’s recommendations was to use an aerospace or military epoxy primer that they have. It was called an Eco-prime, and it’s basically a chromated epoxy. They used it primarily for military applications like naval aircraft where corrosion resistance was an issue. Knowing that the cargo bay doors were aluminum and we were going to be painting the bare aluminum, I wanted to make sure that the topcoat had a good base to bite into. I was concerned that we needed a very good epoxy primer that we could put on as a base, so the Eco-prime ended up being the perfect solution.\\n\\n We actually were able to put the roll additive into the primer as well, about the same ratio that we used in the topcoat, and applied it very similarly. I did the same kind of test panels first, applied the primer and then went with their recommendation, a five-hour flash time, and then we were able to topcoat it.\\n\\n When we actually did the Shuttle, we found out that we really couldn’t do the priming and the painting all in one day because it would push us too far into the early morning hours. The fear was that the hangar wouldn’t evacuate the fumes well enough before the public got there the next morning. We were trying to limit the amount of time that we actually were painting in the evening, to give us plenty of time between the time we knocked off painting and the time the public arrived, so that the hangar would be well cleared of any vapors or fumes for safety purposes."

What NASA had devised for painting that originally is a 3M product called EC-2241, a specialty elastomeric paint that they used.\\n\\n They took this base product, which was white and color, and then they added a ground mica material to it to give it a certain sheen, as well as what they call a Degussa [phonetic] powder, which is a flattening powder. Then you mix it all by a certain weight, and that would give you the material that they applied as a topcoat on the white foam tiles. To do the black it was the same mix, but then they added a carbon black powder that gave it that black look.\\n\\n I had received the tech sheets from Kennedy on how they originally formulated it. We followed it through, and I found that when you did the black paint, adding the carbon powder actually made it very coarse and gritty. We found that the way to get around that was after you’d mixed the whole thing, to strain it through a heavy bronze filter. That actually gave you some very workable material where otherwise it was almost unworkable, it was too lumpy."

They were in pretty poor shape. We had a lot of problems with some mold on the interior of the pods. When we brought them into the shop at Garber, we ended up completely rebuilding them.\\n\\n A lot of the wood structure had some rot in it, and the mold had become an issue early on. We thought it was a possible health risk, and we actually had our safety people come in and do an assessment of the mold to make sure it wasn’t too dangerous. It was deemed that it wasn’t the type that was of great concern, so we went about removing all the rotten members out of the OMS pods and replacing them with new.\\n\\n For the exterior skin of the pods we used a lot of West System epoxy, which is a common epoxy that’s used to do the exterior of wooden hulls on boats. We found that to be very effective. We mixed the West System epoxy with microballoons and found that was very workable. We could mix it almost to a molasses consistency and spread it out over the surface of the pod, and then come back usually within about 24 hours and do the final sanding and shaping of the outer skin of the pods.\\n\\n From there we actually used the same paint that we used on the cargo bay doors and the side walls. We used the Eco-prime primer and then topcoated it with the military spec polyurethane in the same fashion. It was all roller-applied, except there were a few pockets on the pods which made it really hard to get into with a roller. We mixed it in a spray gun, and then sprayed into those areas after we had rolled the exterior surfaces, just to make it a cohesive paint surface on the exterior."

        "utterance": "The actual painting process was about four nights total, but it was spread over about a two-week period. We started with the cargo bay doors first. We started from the left rear, did one side and worked from the rear to the front, and then went to the right rear and worked from the rear to the front of the vehicle.\\n\\n We found that working in teams of four was the best way of going about it. We had two people stationed at the bottom of the doors and two people at the upper end of the doors. There were seams that went vertically on the doors that separated it into sections, and we tackled each section individually, all four of us tackling it at once. We had the two people at the top start at the center, the two people at the bottom start at the center, and then we worked from the center to the top and to the bottom, respectively.\\n\\n We found that the key to the whole rolling process was going through a dry rolling application. We would put a medium to wet coat on, we’d roll out about a 10- to 12-foot square area, and then we’d take the roller and ring it out in the roller pan to where it was almost dry. Then we’d go back over top the area that we had just rolled and found that that was the key to making sure that we didn’t have any sags or runs starting. That gave us a consistent finish that looked very much like a spray finish.\\n\\n The first night we did the priming of the cargo bay doors, we did both sides in one evening. Then we let it sit for 24 hours, came back the next evening and we did the application of the topcoat, the white. Did one coat, then took a look at it when we were done and determined that one coat gave full coverage, looked very consistent. We were satisfied that one coat was enough for the cargo bay doors.\\n\\n Then we continued to do some prep work on the side walls, and came back three or four days later to do the side wall paint application. We did the priming of both sides in one evening, then came back the next evening and did the application of the white. The side walls were a little different in that we didn’t completely strip them to bare aluminum like we had on the cargo bay doors.\\n\\n Essentially we had a bunch of spots where we had gone down to bare aluminum, and spot-primed with this Eco-prime on those bare aluminum spots. Because of the nature of the primer, it was actually a bright greenish yellow color, so we weren’t sure how that was going to cover. We did one application of the white topcoat, and it almost covered. It was so close, but when we stood back you could just faintly see a little splotchiness here and there.\\n\\n It took us probably two or three hours’ worth of application to get both sides done. It was like midnight or 12:30, and the four of us were there. The three guys turned and looked at me and said, “What do you think? Is that going to do it?” I looked at it and I said, “No, I don’t think so. I think we’re going to have to put a second coat on.” Everybody was pretty good with that. I think they wanted to go home, but they knew that we needed to do it, and everybody dug in.\\n\\n We went down and mixed another batch of paint and started putting that second application on. It ended up that we didn’t get out of there till about 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning, but it was well worth it. The second coat made a huge difference. I don’t think we would have been satisfied if we had walked away with only that one coat."

That practice was really for the purpose of getting the roller additive right, knowing that the mix was going to work the way we wanted it to.

We figured the primer coat probably wasn’t as critical as the topcoat, so we had a little bit of time to practice. We knew if we had to, on the primer coat we could come back and sand it if it didn’t come out the way we wanted it to.\\n\\n Luckily it went very well. The first coat went on pretty smooth. We figured out pretty quick that the dry-rolling was really the way that perfected it. We started out on the first major section and didn’t do the dry roll, and we were having problems with some sags and such. Then we thought, wonder if we dry-roll this if that would work. We tried and went back over a little section and saw that that really smoothed it out.\\n\\n We were able to go back on that first section before it had a chance to set, dry-roll the whole thing, and then stand back and realize this is what we have to do for the whole process. This is the only way that’s going to make it come out right. Went from there and used that process on the whole rest of the Shuttle."

        "utterance": "Prior to the actual application of the cargo bay doors, after we were completely done stripping it—we’re down to bare aluminum now, this was with the scrapers—it still left a little bit of residue here and there. So we ended up making our own sanding pads out of Scotch-Brite pads. We took square pads, cut them down to rounds, and then we made a special backing plate so we could apply them onto six-inch random orbital sanders.\\n\\n Then we very carefully went over all the cargo bay doors to get any last-minute residue off little places that we couldn’t get to. Once we did that we were pretty satisfied that we had a nice consistent finish to apply paint to. We used a PPG product, DX330, which is a wax and grease remover called Acryli-Clean.\\n\\n Because of the sheer size, of the square footage of the doors that we were going to need to preclean—everybody got up there, took a section. We had our Tyvek suits on, we had booties on, and we had gloves on so that we weren’t touching it and leaving fingerprints. Then we went through with the DX330 with rags. We’d do a wipe-down and then wipe off with a clean rag. Go through the whole procedure as prescribed by the manufacturer, which is essentially to not let the cleaner dry on its own; you wipe it off before it has a chance to air dry.\\n\\n Once we had the doors all clean, we used an Alodine [chromate conversion coating] on them. This was done with a sponge mop. We were scratching our heads about a month before we actually got to this, and we were trying to figure out how we were going to Alodine the whole surface.\\n\\n Reading some of the tech sheets on the Alodine, they recommended on large areas that you could use sponges. We thought about that and then realized, what about sponge mops. Maybe that would actually work better, because you’ve got that long handle, and if you get the kind that has an attachment where it wrings out the sponge, that would be perfect. The access we had to them from the scaffolding, we could actually reach everything we needed to do without actually standing on the doors.\\n\\n So that was what we did. Ahead of schedule, about a month before the actual application, I sat down and started ordering all these supplies. We got six buckets and we got the sponge mops and got the Alodine. The process we used, we poured the Alodine full strength into the buckets. Decided that was probably the best way to do it, not to dilute it. We used a Henkel product, 1201 GL Alodine.\\n\\n We, again, got a couple people top and a couple people bottom on the scaffolds, started at the middle, and we worked our way top and bottom. Applied it one application. It has a tendency to want to bead up. The trick is keeping the surface wet, so we would apply it, wring it out in the bucket, and then apply another coat on it. Do that continuously for about five minutes, which is the dwell time on it, trying to keep the surface completely wet the whole time so that it doesn’t develop a dry spot.\\n\\n Then after that five minutes we wring it out in a clean bucket of water, go over it with the mops. Work this time from top to bottom, let the water run to the bottom, and we catch it with a sponge mop so it didn’t pool up at the bottom and run down the sides of the Shuttle. We’d keep doing that until the water sheeted clear over the Alodine. That’s when you know you have a good bite to it, then it’s thoroughly rinsed off.\\n\\n We were very careful after we applied the Alodine not to touch it with our hands, because we didn’t want to leave fingerprints or anything that would cause an adhesion problem. I think maybe a day or two went by between the Alodineing process and the actual first topcoating of the primer on the cargo bay doors.\\n\\n On the side walls, most of the surfaces were just sanded paint. We had a few breakthrough areas where we went to the bare aluminum. We spot-Alodined those areas, and used the same process where we wash it with clean water. In those areas we were able to just use a handheld sponge. That was the way we tackled the prep work on the bare aluminum surfaces.\\n\\n The rest of the painted surfaces, they’re wiped down with this DX330 Acryli-Clean, which is what it’s made for. There, again, each person would tackle an area and we would go at it with a wet rag of Acryli-Clean, then a dry clean rag that we would wipe it down following the prescribed method."

I got in touch with our development office, and a couple of the folks there started dealing with Duane out on the West Coast. They were able to come to an agreement that they would donate all the materials we needed.\\n\\n I was having a hard time finding at the shop a scale drawing of the Enterprise, or something that I could figure the square footage. I ended up finding a 1/72nd scale model that had been sitting around in our conference room for years. I took that, and took all the measurements of the side walls and the cargo bay doors, and then multiplied it up by 72. It was about 4,275 square feet that I ended up figuring.\\n\\n I sent that information to PRC-DeSoto and I let them tell us how much paint we were going to need. They ended up sending us 20 gallons of the white and 10 gallons of the primer. We only ended up using about half the amount that they sent us. I’m not sure if that was because they were anticipating we were going to have to roll on two coats on all the surfaces, and we ended up on the cargo bay doors with only one coat versus the two on the side walls, or if when they did their calculations they were actually thinking of a spraying application rather than the roller application. For whatever reason, we only ended up using about half the material that they actually sent us, so we still have a lot of that stuff left over."

We hadn’t realized right off the bat that there was a couple different renditions of that on the Enterprise. We documented all that, we took tracings of each of the different variations, then we left it up to the curator to make the call as far as which version she wanted us to put back on the Enterprise.\\n\\n We had a tracing, we’d hold it up, and then we transferred the tracing onto the Enterprise so we had a penciled outline. Then the actual application of the “Enterprise” and “NASA” were all hand-applied. We outlined it in black sign painter’s paint, and then did an infill on it. We found that the sign painter’s paint worked the best, although it was too glossy. We couldn’t find anything that looked quite right, so I ended up using a PPG product with flattener that we added to it. Painted the whole thing, and we weren’t quite satisfied with it. The problem with flattened paints when you paint by hand is that it’s hard to get a real consistent application. It often looks splotchy, and it did a little bit. It wasn’t too bad, but we just weren’t satisfied with it.\\n\\n After about two weeks of drying we decided to come back and we used a product called Soluvar that they use a lot for paintings conservation. It’s a liquid clear coat. We put an application of that over all the letters, hand-applied, and that gave it a nice consistent sheen. It really made it look a lot more presentable than what we initially came up with, something that we thought was really acceptable once it was done, looked really nice."

Everything was dark except for the hangar itself where we were working. Oftentimes I would bring a radio in there, and we’d have the radio playing for background noise. Usually some classic rock station or something, just to help pass the time.\\n\\n Here we are rolling paint, paying attention to what we’re doing, then all of a sudden we notice down on the floor there’s a SWAT [special weapons and tactics] team that’s come into the hangar. Their stance, the way that they’re moving around, they’ve got weapons in hand, it’s like they’re after somebody. We’re whispering to each other, “Hey, what’s going on down here?” Everybody looks, we stop what we’re doing, “What’s going on? Is there an intruder in here? Why have we not heard anything?”\\n\\n After a minute or two a couple of the guys come over right underneath where we’re painting, and they start whispering up to us. “Hey, did you see somebody come in here and hide? Did you see anything?” “No, we didn’t see anything. No, nothing like that.” Then one of the guys tells us that apparently their sergeant had come in and had hidden somewhere in the facility, and it was their job to find her. So here they are cheating, asking us if we knew where she went. We didn’t. We had no idea where she was at.\\n\\n It was unusual. It was tense there for a minute or so, because we thought “What the heck, are we going to have to be evacuated? What’s going on here?” Then realized it’s just a drill. Also thought it was kind of odd that nobody told us this was going on. We thought that if they knew it was planned they would have given us a heads up that something like that was going to happen."

Then a couple weeks after that we got two or three more people.\\n\\n Once we got everybody going on the project, and everybody was up there sanding and scraping, it was doable. Before that it was just too much to do for too few people. Especially, like I talked about, how intensive it was doing the scraping and how everybody was hurting after a while. If three or four people had to do all of that, it just would have killed everybody. Having it spread out to eight or nine people was a lot more doable than four people."

You do an initial assessment of the work you’re going to do—or you think you’re going to do—what you’re going to need and order those supplies. Then you get into it.\\n\\n Oftentimes you find that the method you thought was going to work the best doesn’t work so good. You have to change gears and decide what’s a better way of doing this? Oftentimes that means going to a different type material or a different method. After a run of three or four days of trying different things and then realizing this isn’t going to work, then we have to take a step back and talk, and decide what’s the next logical way to try doing this? At that point we would decide, and one of us would step out and then go procure the supplies we needed to do it.\\n\\n It was challenging because we were working here at Hazy, and everything else was going on at Garber. Logistically it made it a little bit challenging to get the materials from Garber out to here, get the orders from here to Garber, and then get all the paperwork processed and be able to pick up the supplies and get them from there to here. But it worked out. Just as you said, you have to plan ahead. I think we did that pretty good on this project. I don’t think we had too many work stoppages because of lack of materials.\\n\\n On the sanding, I didn’t realize how tough the latex paint was. Here these guys were going at it for a couple weeks nonstop before I came out and realized, “Okay, I see the problem. This just isn’t going to work, we’re going to have to go to a coarser grit.” If we hadn’t stepped up to that it probably would have taken two or three times as much time to sand it down and get it prepped with the lighter-weight paper that we were using at the time."

I tore the whole back section out of one of the pods and had it all laid out on the ground, and had it almost completely replicated by the time that he came back from vacation. I think he was pretty happy to see that he was going to get a little bit of help on the project.\\n\\n It was not a great project, with all the rot and everything in the wood. I think some of the people didn’t really want to tackle it, but it was all part of the overall scope of work that needed to be done.

We added some additional bracing inside just to make sure that if there was any rot that we couldn’t see or couldn’t get to, that they were plenty strong enough for when we had to hoist them up and put them onto the Shuttle.

        "utterance": "Sure. Yeah, I was born and raised and pretty much lived all my life in St. Louis, except when I was away at university and in the Army. I graduated, undergraduate, from William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, with a B.A. [Bachelor of Arts] in history. My concentration area was the early national period. After graduating in 1968, in the fall of that year, September of '68, I went to England, to the United Kingdom because I had a scholarship to study at the University of Oxford and was there from '68 through the end of the summer of '69, when my draft status required that I either stay in the UK and basically avoid military service or go back to the states, which I decided would be the wisest thing to do. And so from the late fall of '69 until April of 1972, I was in the United States Army. In early '72, in the spring of '72, when President Nixon made his overture to communist China, there was a reduction in force in the military and anyone who had less than six months remaining in their service was given an early out. So I was separated from the service with an honorable discharge in April of 1972, at which time I returned to the United Kingdom and was in Oxford for another almost three years and ended up taking a degree. I was reading law and ended up with a B.A. and M.A. [Master of Arts] in law from the University of Oxford and came back to St. Louis at the end of 1974. For a period of time there, a couple of years from well, really '75 through '78, I worked for a time on a comprehensive architectural survey of the city of St. Louis. My interest, in addition to history, was also architectural history. So I worked on that project for a couple of years and also was involved in a family business for a time. But in '77, I sat what was at that time referred to as the PACE [Professional and Administrative Career Examination] exam for the civil service. I can't remember what PACE stands for anymore; I should. But at any rate, I was contacted by the National Archives in St. Louis and was offered a job at the National Personnel Records Center as a trainee in the Career Intern Development System [CIDS], I guess it was called. And that was in 1978, in the fall. And I was there working for the National Archives and Records Administration, or at that time, the National Archives and Records Service, from that time until I retired in 2017. So when I first started at NPRC, my first permanent assignment was with the Records Reconstruction Branch of the National Personnel Records Center and working in reconstructing and responding to requests that pertain to records that were affected by the 1973 fire. And I did that. I was in that position for almost three years. And then after that, I worked in the Air Force Reference Branch. At that time the Center was organized by a Military Service Branch and a Reconstruction Branch, and I applied and was selected as the assistant branch chief in the Air Force Reference Branch. And there we continued to work with records that had some, well, as you know, a good portion of the Air Force records were affected by the fire. So the experience that I had had in reconstruction was very helpful there in the Air Force [Reference Branch]. And then after several years in that branch, a position opened. There were two archival positions at the National Personnel Records Center at that time. They were appraisal archivist positions, because in the St. Louis Record Center, there was also a large collection of military—Army, Army Air Force, and Air Force—organizational records that had been retired to the records center in St. Louis. They were unscheduled records and there was a project that began, I think it started in 1976, to appraise that collection, which when they started, I think, was over 200,000 cubic feet of records. So I worked in that area for a number of years. And then eventually when an archival unit was established in St. Louis, I applied for that position and was selected as the senior archivist in the St. Louis archives, and then retired from that position in 2017. That's sort of a brief overview."

And I think I also indicated that I was interested in staying in St. Louis. And so that also, I guess, narrowed it down. At that time, NPRC was participating pretty aggressively in the CIDS program, bringing on people. And with that, you came in as a GS-5 and, if you were successful in the training program, in two years, you were advanced through to a GS-9. And I was an archives specialist at that time. There was not an opening for an archivist at that time. Those positions were filled, but there was a need for archives specialists. And so that was the position I was offered, and I did accept it."

Yeah, and then they were able to place you wherever there was an opening, where they had a need when you finished your two years, if you were successful. And, I think, every quarter your assignments were, if I remember correctly, they were quarterly, every three months or so, you rotated into a different operation. And so at the end of that time, you were—it was a rather rigorous program. You were brought before a group of senior managers there, and you had to basically present a paper that described everything you had learned. And then you would be grilled on all of that. And so that went on for two years, basically. And then at the end, they found a place for you where they needed you. And for me, it was in the Reconstruction Branch. And I had spent probably six weeks or a couple of months in that branch, maybe a quarter in that branch, as part of the training. So I was familiar with it. And that's where there was an opening as a GS-9, and that's where I ended up for a number of years. Yeah."

And I mean, by the time you got through it, you understood how all the various operational units in NPRC functioned and, you know, you were sort of in a position to begin. Of course, the other aspect of it was the whole idea of supervision. I mean, that was a challenge working in a—it always is, working with people, having a requirement to evaluate people's performance and make sure that the production requirements of the unit were being met. And of course, as you know, NPRC gets thousands and thousands of reference requests weekly, and there is a huge emphasis on getting those turned around as quickly as possible. But a lot of us were also concerned about thoroughness and accuracy as much as timeliness of response. And in reconstruction, of course, that was a major concern to try to get as much information as you could in the time allotted for responding to a request. Yeah, anyway, I think all of us that worked there at that time, and probably even today, well, there is no separate Reconstruction Branch now—records reconstruction is folded into, as I understand it, all of the reference operations. But, I mean, when we were specifically working with the recovered records and the records that had to be reconstructed, we really felt an obligation to do as thorough and accurate a job for the veterans, and their next of kin who were writing in. And I was always fascinated by, and later on, of course, it became a major concern, the research. People were coming in wanting to know about specific incidents, about people that were involved in particular operations during, especially during wartime, in the First World War and the Second World War, and Korea. So anyway, it was really interesting."

And it was determined—I mean, this is what one learned—that the building was compromised to the extent that they were not going to rebuild that floor. I'm trying to remember. I think it was reckoned that there were 22 million individual service records stored on the sixth floor, and what was recovered, oh boy, you know, it was something like maybe not even 20 percent of the records. So they didn't necessarily need that space to store records anymore, because so many had been destroyed. But so, you know, the building’s roof was rebuilt over the fifth floor. The fire did not really descend below the sixth floor, but water certainly did. And there were a lot of records on the fifth floor that were water damaged and had to be treated for that. But in the ground floor of the building, there was an area in the basement, basically, that was turned over to storage of the recovered records, the records that had been salvaged, having suffered fire and water damage. And it was the one area—the stacks at that time were not air conditioned—but this area, we called it the B-File for burned records, was air conditioned and all of the various preservation requirements that we knew at that time were put in place, and it was a temperature-controlled stack area. And then the other thing that happened—and of course I was involved in it over the years—was that a call went out throughout the federal government and the state and local governments to halt any destruction of records in the custody of those organizations that could help document military service…of course, the Veterans Administration, the Selective Service System, etc. All sorts of different, what we called alternate or auxiliary records, series that could help put together the individual service history of those...[SOUND CUTS OUT]."

In later years when I headed up the archival unit here, a lot of my efforts were in getting those auxiliary series of records appraised as permanent holdings of the National Archives. Of course, the service records themselves were in a contingent—you may or may not know that they were in a contingent status. Nobody was foolish enough to suggest that they be destroyed. But on the other hand, they had not been appraised as a permanent series. So that was something that I was also very much involved in as an appraisal archivist. And hold on a second. I’ve got to get rid of this."

        "utterance": "[ANSWERS ANOTHER PHONE CALL.] Sorry about that. It was a call that I've been expecting for a couple of days. Anyhow, what I was saying is, I think probably the most important part of my work for the National Archives was working on a multiyear effort to get the military service records and the civil service records reappraised as a permanent series of the National Archives and bring them into National Archives’ legal custody. But we had done this work at the National Personnel Records Center in the wake of the fire and brought all of these different series together. Many of them were brought into the building. Others stayed in the custody of the agencies that held them. But there was an agreement that they would not dispose of these records because they were critically needed in reconstructing the service data that had been destroyed in the fire. One of the actions that we always talked about in recon [reconstruction] was this idea of procuring. We would procure copies of records from other agencies in order to assemble a reconstructed file, and one of the issues we had to deal with was the delays involved in that. I mean, where other reference operations were working with complete records, their turnaround time could be much faster. We would have to explain very often to our customers that we were attempting to assemble additional documentation that would hopefully result in us being able to provide a reconstructed service record to them, but that some of this would take time. We were dependent on other agencies to get us the information that was needed. And so that was always something that was a challenge because, very often, some of these requests were time-sensitive. You know, the veterans or their next of kin might be having medical issues and they needed treatment by the Veterans Administration and, in order to get that, they had to produce documentation that they had honorable service in the military. So anyway, those were some of the challenges from day to day that we would deal with. But when I was working there, in the years that I was in Recon, there were quite a number, I would say almost a majority [of the staff], were men who had served in the Army or the Air Force. They knew the records intimately because they were veterans. And then a lot of the women that worked there had also had government jobs during the war and were familiar with military records. And these people, boy, you just learned a tremendous amount from them. Of course, all of them have long since retired and most of them have passed on. But when I was working there, you know, in the early '80s, they were there. And it was really a privilege to work with them and to learn from them about how records were kept and where one could go to obtain information from other record sources. One of the tremendous collections we had there were the personnel accounting records of the Army and the Air Force organizations, the “morning reports,” which were compiled daily. These reports documented who was in a given unit from day to day, and also the unit rosters, which were useful. And those were all in microfilm format. The Army had microfilmed them, and we had a unit within Recon of people that were sitting at microfilm readers, and they would follow an individual through his or her unit assignments day by day—we called those a “follow-through search.” Hopefully, the person writing in could give us some indication of a unit and a time frame in which the service member was serving at a given period. And we could start the search in the unit records at that point to attempt to find them and follow them through from entry to discharge, which again was often a very time consuming effort. But again, the people that I worked with, that were in my section, were just tremendously skilled at that. And, I mean, it was amazing what we were able to do and what people are still able to do in terms of putting record information back together."

And I would say most of the people that I worked with were very careful and scrupulous about not losing any record information. The records were brittle in many cases. They were singed with ash. Some of them were just not legible at that time. Now, I don't know. Did it turn out that you were able to see Meg Phillips’s round table on the fire? They were recording that session from a couple of weeks ago—I guess it was last week—that I told you about. And part of what the presentation there was, the head of the preservation unit in St. Louis described some of the fantastic technological advances that allow information to be recovered, which we could not do in the 1980s, from documents that were totally charred. Using infrared technology, they can recover information. So anyway, it was a major concern that we were careful with these records as they came in to us from the B-File. Of course, there was dry mold on them and that was an issue. Some people were sensitive to that. And as time went on, it became clearer about the health considerations of exposure to dormant mold. You did the best you could. You wiped it off. But it was there at the end of every day. Ashes were swept up off the floor. I mean, yeah, the records recovered from the fire were in various stages of distress, I guess you could say. So a lot of—."

        "utterance": "No, depending on what the request was. But, the vast majority of the requests, what was needed was verification of the total time spent in the military, when the individual went in, when they were discharged, and what the character of their service was. That was critical. Did they have honorable service? Was it something less than honorable? Yeah. I mean, you were basically, as we would say, you get them in and out and have a character of service. Now, sometimes there were, especially when part of what was wanted was documenting injury or wounds and so forth, then you were looking at medical records, if they survived. If they didn't, you would go to the Veterans Administration in the hope that the person had been seen at a veterans hospital prior to the date of the fire and that copies of their medical records were on file with the VA. And so if they had been, NARA had an agreement with the Veterans Administration that they would send us the medical records they had on file on a given individual, and we would incorporate them into the reconstructed file. Verifying medical conditions when a record had been lost in the fire was one of the most difficult things to do. And you could go to the organizational records, again, to the morning reports. And if someone was wounded or became ill on a given date, hopefully there was a remark on the morning report for that date or several days later when the person had been transferred to a medical unit for treatment, and you would be able to document the illness or injury. And very often, requesters were next-of-kin family members who were interested if the service member had been awarded the Purple Heart for having been wounded in action, and we were trying to verify awards and decorations as well. So at any rate, yeah, it just depended on what was being requested. And the other point being made, it always comes up when people learn about the fire and the tremendous loss that occurred. You know, one of the people at the program the other day was from one of the genealogical societies, and she said, \"Well, this is 50 years on. When do you think you'll finish reconstructing all the records that were lost?\" And we lost, I think, probably 16 million individual records. So the way reconstruction occurs is as the result of receiving a specific request for a given record. We are not systematically trying to reconstruct, and there's no way to do it because—that's the other thing I should mention is when the fire occurred, there was no index to these files. We had no idea. You know, you just went out to look to see if a record was there. They were filed alphabetically, and that's what the searching was. And after the fire, you didn't know. There was no sort of index of all of the people who had records on the sixth floor. So we could really only reconstruct based on requests by someone self-identifying, and then we would go to try to see if there was a recovered record and, if not, how we could go to alternate sources to try to verify that the person served and obtain the basic data surrounding his or her service. The good thing that happened in the wake of the fire is that the records that were recovered were put into a database. So, when someone came in, the first thing you would do was search that database and see if there was a recovered record. And also, many of the auxiliary files, the other series that were physically brought into the center, were put into a registry. So if you didn't get a hit on the record itself, having been salvaged in the wake of the fire, you might get a data hit on an auxiliary record. Something that we brought in from—well, was it the Treasury Department or the GAO [U.S. Government Accountability Office] by that time or still the Army or Air Force Finance Branches?—but we brought in millions of individual pay records. And as those records were processed, the individual pay document was put into a registry system. So you might get a hit on a pay record, and that pay voucher would be pulled. And hopefully it was what we referred to as the final voucher, the one where the person was paid as they were discharged from active service. It would be a tremendous bit of data. So yeah, I can tell you there were millions and millions of military pay vouchers that we were able to make accessible for reconstruction. The Air Force and the Army had both created card files, three-by-five cards, at the headquarters of the services, of awards that were made to individuals. Those came to us and we would—if it was a question of trying to verify an award, a Purple Heart or something like that. You would go to search those card files. There were records from service on the Mexican border leading up to the First World War in 1915. Anyway, just all sorts of different, as we said, auxiliary record sources that were searched in the effort to reconstruct a person's military service record if it was destroyed. Yeah."

And in the days and months after the fire, as they pulled records off of the sixth floor and brought them in and did the initial sort of drying and cleaning, those records would go to that unit and there was a computer entry made and the records were filed. They had originally been filed alphabetically when they were on the sixth floor, and there was no database for what was there. After the fire, when they entered the recovered records into a database, they were stored by that entry number. So, you know, presumably the first record that was entered was 0000001.

So you would put a person's name and service number in, and if you were lucky, you would get a recovered record, a B-file. If not, you would get a series of hits for auxiliary records. If you were in a correspondence section, which is where I was, and my employees, they would request those, send their requests to the search section and have them pulled and delivered to their desk, where they would go through them and attempt to add them to a—if there was additional information for a record that was partially recovered, they would add those documents to that file. And if there was no record, they would start, basically, what we called an R-file or a Reconstructed File, and those auxiliary documents that proved the person's military service, you know, when they got in, when they got out, what the character of their service was, if there was information about awards, if there was medical information—all of that would be compiled and put in that reconstructed file. And that record would then go to the data entry people, and it would be entered in as what we would call an R-file or a Reconstructed File. So, I don't know how many, but by the time I left, I think they had probably reconstructed from scratch, so to speak, over four or five million records. So, you know, a lot of work had gone on over those 45 years by the time I retired. So anyhow, yeah."

They would analyze it to see what was available, like probing the databases to see what was available, and then they would request whatever pertinent hits they got for the individual. They would ask either the search section, if there was a recovered record in the B-file stacks, or then there was also the organizational records unit in the Records Reconstruction Branch office—the people that went and searched the microfilm records. As I mentioned, we had the morning reports and the unit rosters. There were other groups of records that were on film, and that request would go to them to search and to make a photocopy. And those photocopies would then come to the correspondence technician who had the case, and they would assemble it all and then generate a response to the requester and provide copies of what they had obtained. There was a document that NARA designed, which stood in the place of the separation document. And so the technician would fill in the data on that form. It was issued with the NARA seal on it, and it would give the person's name, their service number, the date they went in, the date they got out, the character of their service. And that would be in the place of the separation document. Maybe you've heard the term “Department of Defense 214” [DD 214], which is what they call it now. But back in the Second and First World Wars, it was a different document. If that document survived, we would make a copy of that and send it. But if it didn't and we had to pull the information about the person's service history together from alternate sources, that basic data would be put on that NARA-designed form-NA Form 13038. And I'm sorry to say, but I'm blanking on the name of the form. But it was a very formal document that stood in the place of the separation document issued by the service department, by the Army or the Air Corps or the Air Force. So, yeah, that would be the product that the correspondence technician came up with, and we would furnish to the requesting party. And again, the other issue that was a big one for us all was that the records were in the legal custody of the military services—the NPRC was simply holding them for the agency that still had legal custody—that those records were subject to the Privacy Act. So part of our requirement was to analyze who the requester was. We had to make it clear to them that by signing their letter of request, that if they were falsifying who they were, they were subject to prosecution under the Privacy Act. We had to make sure that who we were responding to with information was, in fact, the subject of the record or, if they had died, their next of kin. And beyond that, you couldn't legitimately furnish information to the individual. Now, the records that have come into the legal custody of the National Archives, those are public records. So, it was determined as part of the agreement—again, I was involved with this...it was painful, I mean, the negotiation went on for four or five years at least—between the service departments and NARA, as to when a record would become public. And the determination was made that 62 years after separation from service is when the record would be legally transferred from ownership of the creating agency to the National Archives and then become a public record, and anyone could have the information. So."

Even the oldest records from the Mexican border and the First World War were still in the legal custody of the Army, and they were subject to Privacy Act rules.

And that was one of our big challenges. Of course, the history community and the genealogical community were our allies in pointing out that that was totally fallacious. You learn a lot about how the government operated from looking at the records of the individuals who were responsible for running the government, whether they were civil servants or whether they were military people during wartime or even during peacetime, and realize that this information was hugely important. That was one of the things we had to demonstrate, and we did so. But it took a lot of persuasion. You can understand the history of an organization very often through the records of individuals that worked for that organization, especially in the earlier years when there was a lot of correspondence in the records that documented how a particular operation functioned. I've been retired for five years now, so some of this has become a bit hazy. Some of the issues that we talked about, you know, there were four or five basic criteria that you applied when appraising government records for archival value and deciding whether they should be kept permanently. We had to apply those criteria to the individual service records, and we were successful in doing it. I think, eventually the Archives was fine with that. I mean, we convinced them…and the public certainly was on board from the beginning. But then the issue became this issue of privacy. And that's what took a lot of negotiation with the various service departments, the Department of Defense and the Civil Service Commission to say, when can we safely say these records can be open to the public—when is the government not required to protect personal privacy on all of this? So that was a huge issue. But the other things were really important. You really had to show using established archival criteria that these series were, in fact, legitimately permanent records of the United States."

I mean, I think speaking as a historian, it's the whole top-down view that the only records that really meant anything were the records created by the central offices of various departments that, you know, those were the ones that were kept and not necessarily [other] records. But as the government grew in the 20th century, and the federal government had more of a presence throughout the country in various regions, archivists had to look beyond just the records created at headquarters in DC and see what was going on in the regions. Well, then the other thing is, how about what happened to and what was done by ordinary people, not just the Secretary of Defense or the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But, you know that whole notion of social history, of what ordinary people were doing and how their service affected the history of the United States and its government—you know, all of that has changed in the last 30 or 40 years. Yeah. How archivists are looking at that sort of thing also changed."

        "utterance": "Yeah. Preservation was the first archival function established at NPRC after the military personnel records were reappraised as permanent, and that happened in 1999, I believe, when John Carlin signed the transfer documentation for the military personnel records. It then became critical for NARA to decide how these records that were now in their legal custody would be preserved. And so the first archival unit at St. Louis was the Preservation Branch. And I did apply for the position to head that unit and was selected because the idea was—the NPRC director at that time, David Petree, it was his view that in order for that effort to get off the ground, the person in charge had to understand the records, how they were arranged and stored, their contents, their physical form and current condition, etc. And so that is the basis on which I was selected because I had no personal training in paper preservation or anything, but I was able to hire two just remarkably experienced conservators—we really went for the best, and we hired two conservators to work with me and to begin to design the program first for preserving the recovered records, the burned records. How would they be handled? And we instituted all sorts of handling protocols for NPRC staff. There was a lot of pushback because before that, people were just used to treating those records just like the records that were perfectly intact, that had never been exposed to fire and water damage. And it became clear that it was totally irresponsible to continue handling the burned records that way, or you would destroy the information in these records. So, it slowed things down. And there was an awful lot of pushback from the record center side and, frankly, their fixation on being able to show a very fast turnaround time from when requesters wrote in to when they got their answer. And the protocols that we, in preservation, felt were absolutely necessary to put in place slowed some of that down. I mean, basically, every time a record from the B-file was requested, its physical condition would be reviewed and assessed by a preservation technician, and it would be decided what could be sent on to the Reference Branch safely. And if it couldn't be sent forth without the danger of record information being destroyed in the handling, then we took steps. We made copies of the original and sent the copies, but all that slowed things down. And so it was a constant give and take on what would happen. For instance, generally speaking, before the Preservation Unit was established, searchers would go in, searchers—GS-3s—would go in and pull records from the B-file and they would be stacked in carts and rolled up to the technicians in the correspondence section who were to answer the cases. When the Preservation Unit came into existence, random searchers were no longer allowed in the B-files. Those allowed access to the stack area first had to be trained by preservation specialists in how to handle the records safely, and only those who were trained in those procedures were able to access the records. So that was a change. You know, before that, anybody could go in there, and they did. After that, there were restrictions put on access to the records. It was just necessary. Before the records were appraised as permanent, NARA could basically say, \"Well, they're not our records. It's the service departments, the Departments of the Army and the Air Force, that have to decide how these things are going to be done.\" And they didn't care. I think you understand that agencies really, until there's a legal problem, they could give a rat's ass about non-current records. They're only interested in the records they're dealing with today. Very shortsighted. And that was certainly true of the military services, the Army and the Air Force. They were concerned about the people currently serving. They were not really concerned about former service members. I mean they figured that's the VA's problem. Well, not really if you own the records. The records of former military members document eligibility to have services from the VA. The owner of the records has a responsibility. Yeah. And so, again, there was no question about preservation requirements after the records came into NARA's legal custody. So yeah, that was very interesting. We did cleaning in the lab. I can't remember all the details. I was down there as the archivist in charge of the preservation unit from 2000, I think, to about 2004 or 2005. And that's when the other archival unit, the custodial unit that was tasked with caring for all of the accessioned records including the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard records that had nothing to do with the fire. The Navy and Marine Corps records are really the oldest records in St. Louis, and some of them go back to the Civil War. And one of the big projects we had there—one of the requirements that the Navy insisted upon if they were going to agree to convey ownership of the records over to the National Archives’ legal custody, was that a database be created for those records. And that was one of the projects that I was in charge of. I can't remember the numbers, but several million records from what we call the World War One period—which actually went from the beginning of the Second World War, basically 1939 back to the beginning, which was in some cases the mid-19th century—were entered into a database. Every record was entered into a computer database so that now, after that project—it was a multiyear project—we knew if we had a record for someone who served in the Navy in 1885 or whenever. And again, with preservation, there were protocols in how those records were handled because they are not records in flat files, but they are in tri-fold folders or pockets. And so every time those records are accessed, they have to be unfolded and then refolded. And that's a major preservation issue. So, yeah, we had to institute procedures in how those records were handled. And those procedures represented a major change from the way NPRC had been operating for the past 40 years or whatever. So a lot of challenges."

So as I mentioned, those Navy records that went way back into the 19th century were subject to protocols established by the Preservation Unit in terms of handling. But the first step was to address the burned records, because they were considered most seriously at risk. And that's one of the things that I had to do as head of that unit, basically identify the level of risk involved for the various collections. The woman who was NARA’s head of preservation during those years was an absolutely wonderful person. I mean, hugely brilliant. She came to NARA from the Library of Congress. Her name was Doris Hamburg. I don't know if you ever had any interaction with her, but just a fantastic person to work with. And I learned a lot about preservation, both from Doris and from the two conservation specialists that we hired in St. Louis and who were the ones in charge of establishing the preservation rules and protocols for the handling of the records at NPRC. Yeah."

You just couldn't handle them like disposable material, you know? I mean, if you were like, \"We need to answer this case. We are not really concerned about what happens to the record after we answer the case.\" Well, that's crazy in the first place, because questions about an individual's military service don't come in once and never again. You know, very often somebody wants to know more information. And there are other members of the family. And when the records become accessioned, members of the public are interested. So, you know, these records are going to be handled over and over again. They always were. And so you had to consider that what you were doing was, basically, destroying the physical record. So, it meant slowing things down. And that was a huge issue. I got into disagreements with a lot of people there because of that. And, we had to verify that what we were saying was in accordance with established preservation practice as mandated by the agency itself, by the National Archives. And so it took persuasion, and in some cases, it took someone mandating. But, the issue is it depends on where you were coming from in the agency. I mean, the people in the Office of the Chief of Operations, they're looking at St. Louis as a very sensitive place in terms of dealing with the veterans. And the VA, of course, was happy to say, well, their hands were tied because of bottlenecks at NARA and the National Personnel Records Center. And of course, with COVID and all, I mean, you heard about their backlogs. They were always dealing with backlogs of 10,000…15,000 cases at the end of a given week. And that ballooned up to, I think, as high as 600,000 or something. So, I mean, it was a lot of pressure. And I know, probably some of the things that we put in place were overruled because of that. I don't know. In a way, I'm glad I'm not there today in that regard."

The appraisal function that was directed at, not the personnel records, but at the military field command records that had landed in St. Louis mainly because there was room and that were unscheduled.

We needed to understand what the series were that were accessioned at that point and identify what the volume of incoming accessions would be. With the OMPF, legal transfer to NARA occurred on a rolling date—62 years after separation from active service. So, you know, we had to make sure we had room for everything. The good thing was—and it was really what convinced Congress to fund the new building—is that the military services and the civil service had switched to electronic records, that we had an end point for paper records. You know, we could now say there was a definite volume of paper of individual military and civilian personnel [records] and related records series that NARA would be responsible for. And so that's what we had to plan for in the new building. One of the biggest challenges was when the civilian personnel records were reappraised as permanent. They were at that building, as I told you, in downtown St. Louis, 111 Winnebago Street, the civilian personnel records building. I had two of my archivists down there basically identifying and organizing those records. The older records were physically arranged by agency. And again, for the oldest records, there wasn't an inventory. So you had to go out to the stacks to figure out where they were, what the volume was, and how you would arrange them in the new building. I had those two archivists down there for the better part of two years figuring that out. And then, of course, came the challenge of moving the records. We hired commercial movers, obviously, to carry out the physical moving, but I had my staff onsite, you know, overseeing how the records were handled and in what order they were moved. We preliminarily had to develop an order in the old building and then make sure that that was maintained as they were moved into the new building so we could find them. You know, it was a very major effort. And we're talking about hundreds of thousands of cubic feet of paper records. It was an enormous undertaking. Yeah."

But also at the same time, they were generating that database and putting every record into a database so we knew what we had down to the file level. That, again, took several years to accomplish. And it was one of our proudest undertakings. Those records, by the time we moved into the new building, were in great shape. I mean, we had a database for them.

So basically, we had the job of negotiating with those agencies for the physical shipment of those records into our new building. And that was part of the planning to try to figure out what the volumes were, for instance, files that the VA held going way back, files created by their predecessor, the Pension Office, really old records, ones that were not in A1 and were still in the physical custody of the VA and not in NARA downtown in DC. Those records that were held by the VA at various places in their system, at various locations, we had to find out where they were and negotiate with the VA to get them sent to us in St. Louis. And that's one of the collections that is of tremendous interest to family historians and genealogists, those old pension files that are now in the custody of the National Archives in St. Louis. So, yeah, it was not just moving what we physically had at the time of moving into the new building, but we also had to be projecting what should be coming to us from other agencies, the related series of records that came in. That was a decision that we had to clear with our people in DC, what was appropriate to come to St. Louis rather than go to DC. Of course, there was no room in DC. They'd run out of room in College Park and in Suitland, so it made sense to bring them to us. But all of that had to be negotiated and, in planning the new building, we had to make sure we had the space for all of that. So it was interesting."

They were just really a remarkable group of people. I mean, I was in my early 30s, I guess, and they were in their 50s and 60s. And you just learned a tremendous amount from them.

And the women worked very often for the Army and the Army Air Corps or the Navy during the Second World War and the postwar years, the Korean War. And I mean, they just knew how records were and the reasons and the purposes for the records being created, and they had a tremendous amount of direct knowledge and that's what made, to me, the Reconstruction Branch so incredible in those years. And hopefully the people there now are benefiting from that. Well, there’s our various operating procedures. It was all documented, what you were supposed to do, where you were supposed to go for record information in order to reconstruct the stuff lost in the fire. And those procedures and those reference materials are still there. And hopefully the people working there today are using them. But when I was there, there were people with direct personal knowledge. That's when those processes were put in place, and they knew a heck of a lot. Yeah, it was great."

But, anyhow, the other thing I definitely will do is see if I can come up with contact information for Wendy Hollingsworth. I think she would be a tremendous person to be in touch with, because she was there. I mean, she actively participated in the recovery after the fire. She was working there on July 12, and she was there for the next 30 years or so. Wendy would be a wonderful resource to include in this. So I'll try to find out and follow up on that."

        "utterance": "Well, it all started—years back we had to take a civil service test in order to work for the government, and the government had quotas from every state. So many from New Jersey, so many from New York, so many from Wyoming, and so forth, so the government had quotas. I took a test in Newark, New Jersey, and it was a general test, plus typing. Then I don’t know how many days or weeks afterwards, I got a letter from the government offering me a temporary job. Obviously I passed the tests. It was from the Social Security Board. Would I accept a three-month appointment?\\n\\n I thought, “I’ll ask my parents if I should accept this offer to work in Washington D.C., a couple of hundred miles away from home.”\\n\\n They said, “Yes, why not? For three months? It would be a good experience.”\\n\\n Before I left home for Washington, I worked for a lawyer at five dollars a week. I accepted the offer and went by train to Washington. In those days Washington had many boardinghouses and rooming houses. I would say that most of the people who came to work from out of state lived in rooming or boardinghouses or the YMCA [Young Men’s Christian Association] or the YWCA [Young Women’s Christian Association]. That’s the way it was here in the city.\\n\\n In June 1937, I rented a room in a rooming house off North Capitol Street, near the Capitol and close to Union Station, the railroad station. Commuting by trolley, I worked in the Adjudications Section of the Social Security Board located at 23rd Street and Constitution Avenue. The temporary position was Junior Stenographer at Grade CAF-2, $1440 per annum; I typed letters that lawyers wrote. After three months I was offered an extension, which I accepted.\\n\\n Since my appointment was temporary, in March 1938 I accepted an offer from the Census Bureau at the Commerce Department at a salary of $1260 per annum. I left the Social Security Board and went to the Census Bureau and worked there from 1938 to 1942.\\n\\n One afternoon I attended a concert at the Agriculture Department auditorium where a man who directed a choir in one of the churches in Washington, a Baptist Church, was directing a singing group. Not that they were employees there, but anyone who liked group singing could join this group. I met a girl there who was in the audience. She asked me where I worked.\\n\\n I said, “I work at Census Bureau.” I was there for about three years, I guess, three or four years. “Why? Why do you ask?”\\n\\n “Well,” she said, “we need secretaries where I work.” She worked in the Personnel Office. “Are you a secretary?” she asked me.\\n\\n I said, “Yes, I could take dictation.”\\n\\n She said, “Why don’t you come over to where I work, NACA?” I didn’t know what NACA was.\\n\\n So she said, “Well, come in for an interview. I’ll introduce you to Miss Wheeler, head of the secretarial group.”\\n\\n I said, “Okay, I’ll see if I can find time to come over.” The interview went well and I was hired to join the secretarial pool. There were about a half a dozen girls in the group. Then when I went to report for work, I was assigned to a newly hired engineer who had just come from Ohio. He worked at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. He was a civilian engineer at Wright Patterson. At NACA, he was hired to handle the NACA Power Plants Committee plus a couple of its subcommittees. I worked for Mr. Thomas T. Neill for about fifteen years, taking dictation from him and at times other people, when necessary.\\n\\n In the meantime, while I was at—well, I should preface this. We were at Dupont Circle working in a mansion formerly belonging to the Leiter family which the government took over on Dupont Circle at Connecticut Avenue. It was a four story mansion. We had a complement of maybe fifty on the payroll. Our telephone sheet had two columns of names. [Laughs] So during that time I also took dictation from Dr. William Frederick Durand of Stanford University in Stanford, California, who was one of the main NACA Committee members. Let’s see. I want to show you here. My love. He is such a dear. This one right here. [Shows photograph]"

        "utterance": "Well, ours was this big trip. I didn’t go. “Why don’t you want to come?” I was asked by many of my friends. There were reasons, and they were good ones. My folks—they were poor. My father was the only one working in the family, and in a family of six kids, hey, you don’t just go out and buy clothes and new things just to go have a good time. That was verboten.\\n\\n Anyway, so I didn’t go with the class. They said, “You’ll never get there. It’s so far away.” Exactly, from my house to Washington, is two hundred and fifteen miles. I didn’t take the trip with them. All the kids had a great time visiting Washington. Three days, I think they had. But that didn’t mean anything to me, because I didn’t go, see? They said, “Well, you’re never going to get there. It’s so far away.” Okay, so I didn’t get there, right? Until later on.\\n\\n Well, I stayed with Mr. Neill, the engineer, for about fourteen years, and I was asked one day if I would work for the Secretary of NACA. I said, “No, I don’t think I want to leave Mr. Neill. I don’t want to leave Mr. Neill. He’s been good to me, and I’ve been here so long, you know, and I like what I’m doing for him and the other group in his office.” Dr. John F. Victory, the Secretary of NACA, was the first NACA employee. Hey, I could have been up there with him, but I wouldn’t take the job. They thought I was crazy not to take it. It was a raise in pay, as well. But I stayed with Mr. Neill.\\n\\n Then one day I heard that Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, who was the Director at that time, his secretary was leaving, going back—she was leaving her job and going back to Ohio to live. Mr. Neill told me they had a list of girls, secretaries, that were eligible that they would call for an interview, and in order to work for Dr. Dryden, you also had to work for the Associate Director, John W. Crowley who came from Langley Field in Hampton, Virginia. So there was Dryden, Crowley, and Victory, the three top men, okay? So he said, “Jo, I know you refused the invitations to work for Dr. Victory, and he has asked you why you didn’t want to work for him. But,” he said, “you’re on the list for this job to work for Dr. Dryden and Mr. Crowley, and when you go up there for an interview, I don’t want you to refuse it, because you’re the first one on the list.”\\n\\n “Oh. Oh yes? Who did that list?”\\n\\n Well, Helen did it, his secretary. She made the list up. I had the interview, not with Dr. Dryden, but with Mr. Crowley who said, after a brief interview, “You’re hired.” That’s how I got to work for these two wonderful gentlemen.\\n\\n Then when Dr. James H. Doolittle would come in, he was our Chairman of the main NACA Committee. He came in and had an office they set up for him whenever he was there. From my desk and through the open door, I could see where somebody made his way up to the ninth floor by using the steps. One day, Dr. Doolittle arrived at my office. I said, “Did you walk up the steps?”\\n\\n He said, “Sure.”\\n\\n I said, “Well, why didn’t you take the elevator?”\\n\\n He said, “I’m practicing. I’m getting my legs in shape, because I’m going to Alaska to hunt sheep.”\\n\\n On one occasion, I was sent in to take dictation from him, and the telephone happened to ring, and he said, “Who is this? What do you need? Oh, okay. Well, make sure you get every name spelled correctly.” Whoever was calling him, and I don’t know who called—it could have been from a newspaper—was asking the names of his crew when they bombed Tokyo. But what stuck in my mind was when he told the caller, “You get the names spelled right,” because there were a lot of people whose last name ended with -ski; they weren’t Jones and Smith. And he spelled them all over the phone. Boy, you can’t get away with anything with this man. You’d better get the spelling right. He was very sharp, real good. But anyway, those days were wonderful. We had wonderful times, and I was happy to go to work every day, no matter what the weather was.\\n\\n Then we became NASA in 1958, the transition, of course. Those were exciting times, because of Sputnik. We moved from the ninth floor on H Street to the Dolly Madison house next door, where the first Administrator, Dr. T. Keith Glennan, served his term. Later, when Mr. James E. Webb followed Dr. Glennan as Administrator, NASA had its own building (F0B-6) at 4th and C Streets, SW. Dr. Dryden had an office on the southwest corner, and Mr. James E. Webb had an office on the northwest corner.\\n\\n Oh, but prior to that—I’m getting ahead of myself—when we became NASA, we were in the Dolly Madison House off Lafayette Square across from the White House. Dr. Glennan interviewed a girl outside of NASA. She might have come from the State Department, I’m not sure. But he told me the reason he didn’t select me as his secretary was because he would only be there for two years, which I appreciated, and he said, “I wouldn’t take you away from Dr. Dryden.”\\n\\n I said, “Well, I wouldn’t leave Dr. Dryden.” I wanted him to know even if he asked me, I wouldn’t leave, and he knew that. So that was okay. But we had a good relationship, and we worked in those offices. Dr. Dryden’s office was a meeting room. It was a huge room. On the conference table, machinery was set up to have the first telephone communication from Washington to Australia via the satellite, and that was an experiment they were doing at NASA at that time. So Dr. Dryden was the first to talk to Australia via satellite. That was exciting, to have the first satellite transmission. Very good. Hey, it worked. So he did talk to somebody in Australia.\\n\\n And, of course, Dr. Dryden got ill, unfortunately. He attended so many meetings everywhere in the world in smoke-filled places. As it was customary in the government, they have medical exams of all the officials. The exam revealed a spot on his lung. This man never smoked in his life, but he was in very many smoke-filled rooms, and that’s what they concluded probably started the cancer in his lungs. Of all things, good God. So that’s what he died from.\\n\\n Anyway, I’m telling you the history of his life."

It was truly a treasured privilege to work for Dr. Dryden.\\n\\n When Dr. Dryden died, however, of course, I was included with the family in the church as well as at the burial. There were fifty black limousines—fifty, from Washington to Baltimore, Maryland.\\n\\n I didn’t stay in that office anymore, because Mr. Webb came on board, and Dr. Glennan had finished his two-year term. What else? Oh, yes, I moved out of that building and went to work for the Aerodynamics Division. You work for one boss for ten years, and then you have about six bosses in a couple of years. [Laughs] You have to adjust to every single one of them. So I don’t know who came on. Who did I have, Dr. Adams, Mac C. Adams? James M. Beggs? Oh, Roy Jackson [phonetic]. Roy Jackson was the last boss I had. I don’t know how long you’ve worked, but when you go from one boss to the next, you have them for a year, nine months, whatever.\\n\\n Mr. Beggs used to work for Westinghouse, and when he came, they gave him the job of head of the Aerodynamics Division. Half the time he was across the street at FAA [Federal Aviation Administration]. So I said to him, “Mr. Beggs, you work here, don’t you? You were hired for the NASA. You work for NASA.”\\n\\n He said, “Well, they’ve asked me to participate,” and so he was spending a lot of time across the street rather than—but he was good-natured about it.\\n\\n But I said, “You’ve stayed here long enough to have a baby, and that’s it.” Nine months, and then he left. But he’s a nice guy to work with. And I got along with all the other men. I said, “Gee.” But, you know, it takes something to get used to after you’ve had Dryden, Durand, Crowley. Hey. But I got along with them all right.\\n\\n By 1972 I decided that it was time to retire, knowing the benefits would be better than staying on board for some other jobs. After Dr. Dryden died, Mr. Webb wanted to create a job for me. I didn’t want him to do that."

I don’t know how they get their jobs. When I was hired, you had to pass a test, and they held tests all over the country. That’s how they hired people for civil service. It’s changed. Everything’s changed.\\n\\n An opening came in the Aerodynamics Section across the street. We had another building; the two buildings were close. So I accepted that. I said, “I’ll go to Aerodynamics. I know those people over there.” So that’s how that worked."

I don’t know, what do you want to know about, the first floor? Of course, that was the entrance where Helen Robinson—I hope when she comes, she’ll tell you about that. That contained the engineers, like the one I worked for, Mr. Neill, the secretaries across the way; and a few more engineers in the—we worked in the ballroom. Oh, yes, that ballroom was—the ballroom was huge in this house, I’ll tell you. Then, well, they put a partition on one end, and then the next door were a couple more, two or four, engineers next door. Then Russ [Russell G.] Robinson, who happens to be the husband of Helen Robinson, he had an office by himself. All part of the ballroom. Then in the front of the building near the Circle—Dupont Circle—was Dr. George W. Lewis’ office, and outside his office was a small room where there was a secretary to him and a secretary to Dr. Victory. And then one room for Dr. Durand whenever he came in from Stanford.\\n\\n Then there was an elevator fit for maybe only two people—it was an old building—up to the fourth floor or the attic. I think it went to maybe the third floor. Yes, I think it was the third floor. Dr. Jerome C. Hunsaker, NACA Chairman, came from Massachusetts every time they had the meetings. He would take the elevator to the third floor to walk up to the attic, which was a finished room. In that room was a bed. Anytime he came in from Massachusetts to attend a meeting, that’s where he would stay overnight. We saw him a number of times walking across Dupont Circle to the laundry. He was carrying his laundry underneath his arm. [Laughs]\\n\\n Oh, dear. Those were good old days. You asked me about good old days. We had fun the first years I was there, yes. This was a good life. Ask me more questions. Maybe I can answer them."

That was one of the things they used to do, and I guess there were others that I don’t know about. I really don’t.

These engineers, whenever they did any work, would write a report, and reports were called “research memorandums” or “technical notes,” and some were classified; some were not.

And whoever was assigned to work in that department, maybe the Wind Tunnel Department, maybe the shop that made all the designs and built the things, that department. But they had inspections, okay.\\n\\n From Washington there was a boat that ran from Main Avenue to Old Point Comfort in Virginia. Dr. Victory would rent the boat or hire the boat or however you want to say it, the overnight boat, invite all of the industry people and government people, officials, military and otherwise. Then he would assign the young girls who worked in the secretarial pool to be sure and be at the dock and check these people in. Well, the young girls liked that. I liked to meet all these people coming on the ship.\\n\\n So Dr. Victory, the Secretary, would set this up. He would also invite some of the female employees on this list of fifty people to go. But each time he did this, he would invite the same people to attend, and we in the secretarial pool wondered, “Hey, why don’t we ever get invited to these inspections? Why is Dr. Victory always selecting the girl from Personnel, the girl from Budget Office? They get to go every year. What are they learning about this? We’re the ones who are working with the reports that these engineers send up here.” [Laughs]\\n\\n One day I was called into Dr. Victory’s office to take dictation from him. I did what I had to do and then we started to talk, because it was that time that he was inviting people to come to the inspection. I said, “Dr. Victory, I understand—blah, blah, blah, blah—that you’re inviting women to the inspections. Is it possible for any of us secretaries from the pool to go down and see, see what all this is about, what we’re familiar with on paper, but that’s all? We see all this technology stuff we’re reading; we don’t know what we’re reading, to tell you the truth.” As a matter of fact, we didn’t know what we were seeing down there, either. But I said, “Wouldn’t it be nice if maybe a few of the girls from the secretarial pool could be invited to go down there?” Everybody thought that was a lot of nerve to ask the man.\\n\\n But anyway, he said, “You know, you got something there.”\\n\\n I said, “Okay.” A few of us girls in the secretary pool were invited to go on the ship to go down with everybody else, and no other people but invitees were able to get on the ship at that time. The boat was reserved strictly for NACA. Anyway, it was quite an experience. As a result, Dr. Victory started inviting ladies to go to Cleveland when they had their inspection, which was okay, too. That’s the way it should be. You can’t send the same people all the time. They’re not getting any more knowledge than we would get from the first visit."

I don’t even know where it was held.\\n\\n When it was time to leave, Dr. Dryden was going back to the States.

Like if you looked out here, maybe a block away was the railroad tracks going south to Florida. Dr. Dryden had a visitor in his office at that moment. I looked back when I heard the trains, and I thought, “Oh, that’s the circus train.” It was a long one; each car had open slats with animals you could see. I don’t know whether you ever saw that. But anyway, I rang him. I said, “Dr. Dryden, the circus train is going south. You can see it from your office, going down the tracks.”\\n\\n He and the fellow got up, went to the other end of the room just to watch the whole train go by. He appreciated that. [Laughs]"

        "utterance": "This really covers a great bit about what I did with the NACA. It was the promotion for me to get my GS-13 by Carl [A.] Sandahl at the NACA. So I’ll just read what this says, because I can’t tell it any better. In fact, I think they gilded the lily a little bit:\\n\\n Mr. Lee was employed by the NACA as a mechanical engineer, grade P-1 in August 1948, and was assigned to Propulsion and Aerodynamics Branch at Pilotless Aircraft Research Division. …\\n\\n During his employment at PARD, Mr. Lee has gained experience in a wide variety of research programs including both ground and flight test investigations. The major portion of his experience, however, has been with investigations conducted in the Wallops Island Preflight Jet Facility which includes the design and calibration of supersonic nozzles, ram jet engine performance tests, pilot ejection capsule tests, internal store release tests and schemes for surface cooling of blunt noses.\\n\\n During the past two years, [and I think that this is my most significant contribution at the NACA] Mr. Lee had been in charge of all the drop model work in the Preflight Jet. This work has involved original NACA drop studies as well as a close cooperation with outside agencies including the AEC [Atomic Energy Commission], several aircraft companies, the Air Force bombing group at Kirtland Air Force Base [New Mexico], and the Sandia Corporation. Mr. Lee accomplished this work expeditiously despite the fact that the number of principals involved frequently made conditions less than ideal. Because of this work, Mr. Lee has a wide reputation as an authority on store and bomb dropping problems as evidenced by the frequent requests for assistance he received from the Air Force and industry.\\n\\n In the course of the foregoing work, Mr. Lee, has during the past two years, (a) brought to a high state of development the drop model techniques as employed in the Wallops Preflight Jet. This includes the development of lighting and camera equipment and methods for constructing the dynamically scaled models. (b) Demonstrated dangerous deficiencies in the original Mk-7 store proposed for the F-105 airplane. He subsequently developed a store fin configuration which resulted in successful drops. (c) Demonstrated the superior dropping characteristics of bluff store shapes including the flared-cylinder. This work led to the adoption of the internally carried store shape currently in use by the F-105 airplane. (d) Developed the so-called modified light-model simulation method wherein the gravity field deficiency inherent in the basic scaling method is circumvented by accelerating the parent model upward at the store separation. This method was used in drop model tests in the AVCO test vehicle; subsequent full scale drops verified the model tests. (e) Supervised drop model tests of the Ding Dong missile. This work demonstrated for the first time the use of a two leg ejection system capable of imparting pitching as well as variable velocities to an internally carried store to ensure successful ejection.\\n\\n Mr. Lee is currently in charge of tests to determine the drop characteristics of external fuel tanks and stores proposed for the F-104 airplane. He is also in charge of a study of a method of externally cooling the surface of blunt shapes. This latter work is underway in the Wallops Preflight High Temperature Jet. In this work Mr. Lee directly supervises several engineering aides. He is a competent supervisor and project engineer. . . .\\n\\n This was written by Carl Sandahl. Of course it’s signed by Maxime A. “Max” Faget, Joseph A. “Joe” Shortal, the PARD Division Chief, and signed off by Robert R. “Bob” Gilruth.\\n\\n I explained to you yesterday about how a model would come out, and it looked like it would fly back up and hit the airplane. But what it was—the airflow in the bomb bay would impinge on the tail, and it would cause it to tip up. We developed a two-point ejection system so that we could eject it nose down and get it away from the airplane. That was a significant contribution.\\n\\n I think that pretty well covers what were some of my significant contributions at the NACA—unless you have some other questions you’d like to ask on it."

Now on to some of your other questions: “Tell us about working at Wallops Island; how you got to the island; how much time did you spend there once you arrived; where you stayed; what were you doing during this free time?” Wallops Island was on what was known as the Eastern Shore of Virginia. That was the peninsula that came down on the other side of the Chesapeake Bay. Sometimes we would drive over to Norfolk, get on a barge, go over to the end of that peninsula, and then drive up to the island. There we had to get on a boat and go across through a marsh in order to get to the island so it wasn’t easy."

        "utterance": "The Flight Research Division had a seaplane that they called a “Goose” and sometimes they would fly us from Langley [Research Center, Hampton, Virginia] up to the island, land on the water, and then taxi up to the dock. That was the best way to go. We had one pilot who I thought was kind of crazy and not a very good pilot. On one of my trips, he ran up on the dock and knocked the float off of the left wing of the airplane.\\n\\n When I’d go up to fly test models, I might be up for a day or two, or even three days, getting it launched, getting the data, and then come back to the Center. When I was conducting the drop tests, I would go up for a whole week at a time. I would take my fishing poles, which were surf casting rods. One was the usual surfcasting rod and reel. The other was a new invention at that time with an open-faced spinning reel and spinning rod. On that you would use a lighter line. On the island, just north of the launch facility, there were barracks there that they called a hotel. It was right on the Atlantic Ocean, protected by a sand dune. We would have two bunks in a room, a lower bunk and an upper bunk. It had a kitchen that provided us three meals a day.\\n\\n I’d get on the airplane with my fishing rods in a tube. People would tease me and ask, “John, what have you got there?” I would tell them, “Those are my calibration rods.” Sometimes Caldwell [C.] Johnson and I would go up at the same time, and we would room together. He was an expert model airplane builder. I think you know Caldwell’s history. While I was out fishing, he would sit on the floor without any drawings, a picture or anything, and he would build a scale model of an airplane. He did that one week, and that weekend he took it and won a rubber model airplane contest with it. Those are the kind of things we did for spare time. It wasn’t bad.\\n\\n We had a couple of guys, George and Harvey, who would cook our meals and they were characters and very funny. George would have a lit cigarette in his mouth with ashes on the end while he served the food. One day Caldwell looked at his food and said, “George, there is a fly in my food.” George replied, “He doesn’t eat much.” So we were kind of roughing it. I could get off on that and tell some interesting stories.\\n\\n When I first started fishing, I asked George, “Where’s a good place to fish?” He said, “Just right out there.” It turned out that he did not really know so I went right out there just over the sand dune. Sure enough, I started catching speckled trout and things like that. In the spring on the full Moon in May, the redfish would come up the coast going north. In the fall, they’d come down the coast on the full moon in October.\\n\\n I was out there one night fishing in October—this was before anybody had known that the redfish were there—and I hung on to a great big redfish. I hadn’t done much surf fishing for large fish before. I was there all by myself. I was afraid that he was going to pull me in the water. I kept backing up and backing up, and I finally fell down backwards on a sand dune. Then I looked, and I saw this silver fish shining in the Moonlight close to shore. I was really excited. I went down and picked up this great big redfish. I started running to the hotel with it, but it was so heavy that I had to stop and put down the fish. I started to run again, and I had to put the fish down a second time. Finally I got to the hotel, and I threw that fish on the living room floor. He weighed 42 pounds!\\n\\n There were about a half-dozen people there. There was a young engineer from the Grumman Aircraft Company from Long Island, New York. I was running tests for their airplane and stores in the preflight jet. He went back out with me. Some of the other people came running out to fish and to watch. Part of fishing is patience. They finally got tired and went back in. The engineer from Grumman had never seen a fish that large before. He was very excited and he stayed with me. He said, “Catch another fish, John, catch another fish!”\\n\\n I would use a piece of cut-up mullet, which included his head, and this particular time I had the head of a mullet on a large hook. Redfish are bottom feeders, and they have a very hard mouth that they could crush shells with it. You could not set a hook in his hard mouth. What he does is he “mouths” the bait, and then he runs a ways before he swallows it. That’s when you set the hook.\\n\\n There was a full Moon behind the clouds, and there was a break in the clouds. When I saw this I said, “Now do you see that break in those clouds? When that Moon comes out from behind that cloud, I’m going to catch another redfish.” So sure enough when the Moon came out from behind the clouds, I felt one on my line, and I said slowly, “There he is! There he is!” He said, real excited, “Catch him John, catch him!” I said, “No, no, I have to let him run first.” So I let him run. When I finally set the hook, I had caught a 36-pound redfish.\\n\\n Joe Shortal, the PARD Division Chief, wrote a book on the NACA History of Wallops Island. That is a precious book. It has a picture of me the next day, with those two big redfish hanging on the rack with my fishing pole. [next page] That is a part of that history book. I tell people that my claim to fame at Wallops Island was catching those two big redfish. Later on, Gene Schult who had been my roommate came up and caught two redfish so his picture is in the book along with mine.\\n\\n When the people on the mainland found out that the redfish were there, the next night they came down and went on the south end of the island where there was a great big gut coming out of this marshland from behind us. They went down there with larger poles and heavier lines than what I had. Or they would use a great big hook on a piece of rope, tie it around a log, and throw it out in the surf. That night great big redfish came through that gut. I was told that the redfish tore up every piece of tackle that they had. I was so tired that night that I couldn’t get out of the chair and go down with them so I missed that. But I had a ball. Anyway, you asked the question so I answered.\\n\\n The next night they evacuated us because Hurricane Hazel was coming in. That night as we left in the Goose, I looked out of the window at a big beautiful full Moon. I could not believe that a hurricane was coming in. The next morning we had to go to work then they let us go home at the height of the hurricane with winds at 95 mph, but that is another story."

        "utterance": "Of course, as I said yesterday, I got there right after [Chuck] Yeager had broken the sonic barrier in the Bell X-1 Rocket Airplane and flew faster than the speed of sound. We were beginning to fly airplanes and rocket airplanes at subsonic, sonic [Mach number 1], and supersonic speeds of Mach number 2.\\n\\n I did some testing at Mach number 2, and I wrote a TM [Technical Memorandum] on the results of one of these tests. In my title was, “High Mach Number.” When you wrote a TM, you had to go through an editorial review board. The chairman wouldn’t let me put “High Mach Number” in the title. I asked him, “Why not? It is twice the speed of sound.” He said, “Yes, but do you know how high a Mach number you can get?” I said, “No.” Nine years later we were flying at Mach number 15. Going from subsonic speeds to Mach number 15 and putting atomic warheads into outer space and reentering them to develop the heat shields for safe reentry was on-the-job training. That era was so exciting and challenging for us “crazy NACA nuts.”\\n\\n We would design, develop, test, and fly the models, and we’d write the final reports. We took projects from birth to grave. Now during this period of time while I was doing my work in the preflight jet, which I thought was very important, the branch under Max Faget was flying models up to Mach number 15. As I told you earlier, he had found out that we could not get an airplane to go much faster than Mach number 6, and that we would have to go in a new direction to be able to put something into outer space. When we started flying these nose cones and ballistic missiles into outer space, which were models of atomic warheads, Max came up with the idea that we could put a man in space using a blunt-shaped reentry vehicle. I think I talked to you about that, but I didn’t tell you the significance of it—that you could not get an airplane to go that fast.\\n\\n I remember seeing Max in his office with his feet on his desk running the slide rule. At the time I did not know what he was doing. He was running calculations to see how he could put his rocket-boosted spacecraft into orbit around the Earth. My ex-wife [Dottie Lee] used the Friedan calculator to do the calculations for the heating on these reentry vehicles. I ask people today the question, “How many of you can believe that the manned spaceflight program was started on a slide rule and a Friedan calculator?” Doesn’t that send chills through your spine?"

        "utterance": "Then I went through how Bob Gilruth and Max Faget had sold the idea to the President of the United States and to Congress.\\n\\n You also asked if I was active in any social groups, athletic teams, or charitable organizations at Langley. I’m not sure I can say too much about social groups. We were working so very hard, but we had intramural baseball and basketball teams and I played on both of these. We also had a duck pin bowling league that I was also on. I do not know of any duck pin bowling alleys today. We had a gymnasium where they carried out a number of activities. That was near the end of the Big Band Era, and Louie Prima with Kelly Smith and several other big name bands came there.\\n\\n On the Langley Air Force Base, there was an Officer’s Club which we were able to go to. They had slot machines and some of the best food—especially prime rib. There were times when I was able to pay for my meal out of the slot machines. So that was very pleasant. They also had music for dancing. Shirley Schult, [Max Faget’s secretary and Gene Schult’s wife], sang for one of the orchestras.\\n\\n At PARD we grew up in the design, development, and testing world and writing the final reports. We took a project from birth to grave, and we were always expanding the envelope. We were doing things that people had never done before. So by going from the NACA to NASA, we were the people who had grown up in the field and knew how to design and take a project from birth to grave. By this time we knew what the Mercury spacecraft design was going to be like.\\n\\n We had essentially designed the Mercury spacecraft when we turned it over to the contractors. That is why they were able to answer our RFP [Request for Proposal] within a month; in two weeks, we had evaluated the proposal and had rewarded a contract. In six weeks we had let a contract on Mercury to the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation. This is a feat that has never been duplicated before or since. That’s how the NACA experience helped us.\\n\\n In the questions you sent, you asked about my memories of Sputnik. The answer to that was that it was a shock, like it was to everybody else. What the NACA had done, and my division [PARD] under Bob Gilruth, Max Faget, [Joseph] Guy Thibodaux, and Paul [E.] Purser had done was to start the manned spaceflight program. We were ready for the challenge. What I’d like to point out here is that when we designed the Mercury spacecraft, it was a great paradigm shift. We went from flying a man in a winged vehicle to a man lying in a seat in a blunt-shaped vehicle. This was something that had never been done before. PARD was the “eye of the storm” for the manned spaceflight program. Sputnik gave the nation the incentive to start the Mercury Program so we were ready for the challenge when it arrived. That’s what was so great about Bob Gilruth, Max Faget, Guy Thibodaux, Paul Purser and others—they already knew what we could do, what had to be done, and how to do it.\\n\\n I was excited and elated to be accepting challenges for things that had never been done before. I always loved a challenge. In Mercury I started picking up responsibilities, and instead of putting me under the Aerodynamics Group, I was made the head of the Mechanical Systems Section. My section had the responsibility for: 1) the propulsion systems, 2) the reaction controls, 3) the parachutes, and 4) the pyrotechnics. Most of these things I knew very little about.\\n\\n The propulsion systems included the escape rocket motor that was to pull the capsule off of the booster in case of a booster malfunction, and the posigrade motor, which was attached to the launch escape tower that would pull the tower from the capsule on a successful launch. The reaction control system would control the attitude of the spacecraft in orbit and orient it so that it could reenter the atmosphere. The retro-rockets would bring the spacecraft back in from outer space. The spacecraft did not change orbits. The ring-sail drogue would pull the main ring-sail parachutes out of its canister that would open for landing. I was responsible for the development of these two parachutes with Radioplane in California. This ring-sail parachute design has been used on all of our spacecraft programs since then. The pyrotechnics on the Mormon clamps for the escape rocket motor and for the retro-rocket package had to work for a safe landing in a rough sea if necessary.\\n\\n Our subsystems had to work from the time of ignition at launch until the time the spacecraft landed safely in the water. So on the first launch of the Mercury spacecraft test vehicle, I was really sweating bullets.\\n\\n I was busy trying to handle all of these things all by myself with the help of other experts around the Center. All of a sudden Max Faget added about seven people to my section. He brought in six young college graduates. They were Phil [Philip M.] Deans, Walt [Witalij] Karakulco, [James] Kirby Hinson, Robert Rollins II, Jim Saunders, and David Winterhalter, Sr. For some reason, Robert Rollins soon left. I put them on the parachute program because we were having problems at that time.\\n\\n Dick [Richard B.] Ferguson was transferred in from another part of the Center. I gave him the job of working on the hydrogen peroxide reentry control system. I didn’t know that he didn’t know anything about them. A few years ago I asked him, “Dick, did you know anything about hydrogen peroxide rockets when you took over that?” He said, “No.” He did an excellent job on it. As I said, it was on-the-job training for all of us.\\n\\n I didn’t know anything about propulsion either. Max brought in Charles [W.] Yodzis, who had experience in propulsion, and so I gave him the assignment of working with Guy Thibodaux on the rocket motors. He finally left me and went to work for Guy, but I was still able to draw on Guy’s support. Guy was still in PARD and had not joined the Space Task Group at that time. When we moved down here to Houston and started designing the engines and the rocket motors for Apollo, Guy came down from Langley and became the chief of the Propulsion Division at the Space Center for Max Faget. Charles Yodzis was still with him."

In many cases, we were ahead of them. We had a contract with Bell for the hydrogen peroxide reaction control subsystem, which was highly classified, which I think was for the Air Force. It was hard to work with them on the program to find out what they were doing. They were reluctant to give us information.\\n\\n One of your questions was about who made the decision to include solid propellants for launch escape systems, and why was this preferred over liquid propellants. This is a very interesting question. We had a lot of experience in using solid fuel rocket motors in our flight test programs off of Wallops Island. The solid fuel is self-contained, more reliable, safer, and easier to work with than liquid fuel and its chemicals. So the solid fuel rockets had a great many things that made it far superior to use than liquid fuel rocket motors for what we were doing. Our tests of these rocket motors were in free flight or on test stands outside of a facility. These decisions were made by Gilruth, Max, and Thibodaux.\\n\\n The aerodynamics for scaled models were run in some of the NACA wind tunnels. The preflight tunnel was the only wind tunnel on the Wallops Island and that was not used for testing the spacecraft. Max had tests run on different heat shield configurations in a high temperature jet facility at Langley Field. I was not too familiar with them, but he told me that from these tests they had found the circumference of the heat shield so that it would have even-heat distribution over its entire surface. They also found the angle of the side walls of the spacecraft so that it would have equal distribution of heat over its surface. As I mentioned earlier, he had also tested the spacecraft reentering with the heat shield still on the spacecraft that was successful. Those times were interesting and exciting. This was the type of information that was given to the contractor to show them how the spacecraft was to be designed and built.\\n\\n Before I was put in charge of the escape rocket motors, while we were still at the NACA, Max had already come up with a configuration of what the capsule would look like. He had built a full-scale model of the spacecraft with the escape rocket motor on it. He had it launched off of Wallops Island. The launch facility was about a quarter mile south of our living quarters. Woody [Willard S.] Blanchard was the project engineer for the test at that time.\\n\\n There are three nozzles on the escape rocket motor. On launch, when that rocket motor was ignited, one of the inserts in one of the jet nozzles came out. The spacecraft, with its rocket motor still firing, started tumbling and was coming straight up the coast. There were about twenty of us standing on the sand dune at the hotel watching it. When I grew up playing baseball my father had told me, “Now, when a foul ball is hit and you don’t know where it is, don’t go running around because you might run into it. Stand, watch, and find out where it is.” So I watched the configuration come tumbling by us with its rockets still firing. This was quite a spectacular sight. It landed in the water pretty close to where we were standing, just a few feet off of the shore. Abe [Abraham D.] Spinak was one of the engineers that ran the preflight jet. When I looked around, he and I were the only two still standing on that sand dune. Everybody else had scooted! The problem of the inserts in the escape rocket motor was solved before it became my responsibility. That was very interesting and exciting."

        "utterance": "Redstone Rockets in California had the contract for the escape and posigrade rocket motors. Static tests of the escape rocket motor showed that when it was ignited, it would start, stop, and then it would catch and fire. The timing had to be exactly right. You couldn’t have it not igniting immediately.\\n\\n I got hold of Guy Thibodaux. He said, “Well John, get me the records from the contractor.” So I got the records, and I showed them to him. Guy said, “Oh, you have got a hang fire.” That is, the igniter was not immediately igniting the solid fuel. Guy and I got on the plane, and we went out to Redstone, California, to see the contractor.\\n\\n The next morning at breakfast I asked him, “Guy, how are we going to play this thing today?” He said, “We’ll sit and wait to see what they have to say, and then we will tell them what’s wrong.” We go in the meeting, and we were sitting around a table and here came these two young engineers running in saying, “We know what happened; we know what happened.” Guy said, “You can’t tell me what happened. I know what happened. You had a hang fire.” Their mouths dropped open and said that that was also their conclusion. I could hardly keep from rolling in the aisle laughing. You have probably talked to Guy Thibodaux. You know nobody’s going to get ahead of him. That was the funniest thing.\\n\\n Dick Ferguson worked for Guy after Guy left PARD in Virginia and came here to Houston to head up the Propulsion and Power Division for Dr. Faget. A couple of years ago I told Dick that story. He went and told Guy what I had told him. I said “Dick, I didn’t mean for you to tell Guy.” He said that he couldn’t help telling Guy because he thought it was so funny. He knew Guy probably better than I did because he became Guy’s deputy and the Division Chief after Guy had retired. That was typical of Guy. We had fun.\\n\\n The drogue parachutes opened at 10,000 feet and landed on the water. Radioplane had won the contract for the parachutes on the Mercury Program. It included the main parachutes and a drogue parachute. The drogue chute would pull the main parachute from its canister so that it could be deployed. It was a little more complicated than that. When we started with the parachutes for the Mercury Program with Radioplane, they brought in their parachute which was a regular, standard-type parachute. We made a drop test with this parachute on a full-scale model of the Mercury spacecraft, and the parachute failed to open. We could not have a parachute that might fail.\\n\\n Radioplane came back with their brand new design known as the ring-sail parachute. It was a composite of horizontal rings of strips of cloth that were separated from the rings above. It had very positive opening characteristics, and so we developed a 90-foot one for the Mercury spacecraft, and it proved to be perfectly safe. The drogue parachute was made the same way. One of the requirements at that time was that the drogue parachute would be deployed at supersonic speeds so I had the task of developing that drogue chute at supersonic speeds. Dr. Gilruth sent me down to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida because the Air Force had developed a two-stage rocket test vehicle which would give us the Mach number 1.4 that we needed. The Air Force had developed the booster to use to test the Steinthal drogue parachute for the Air Force under contract to Cook Electronics.\\n\\n I took our drogue parachute down there and put in their two-stage launch system. This was their first flight using this new launch system. When the first stage fired, the second stage also fired so the test was a failure. We pulled out all of the drawings trying to find out what went wrong. I was not an electrical engineer, but I could follow a wiring diagram. I found out that they had used a switch that had two leaf springs in it. One was to fire the first stage, and the second one would fire the second stage. I took a look at the thing, and I asked, “Well, if they both closed at the same time, they would ignite the boosters at the same time, wouldn’t they?” They said, “Yes.”\\n\\n At this time on the Mercury Project, we were going through all the boosters that we were going to use with a fine-tooth comb and getting rid of all of the single-point failures. We wanted to make certain that we wouldn’t have any single-point failures on the launches with the astronauts. We didn’t want to lose any of the astronauts. One of things that I had to admire about the astronauts was that they would go to the Cape [Canaveral, Florida] and watch the Air Force launch their rockets: the Atlas, the Deltas, and other rockets, and they would watch them blow up on launch. They were having about 50 percent or 60 percent failures on these boosters, and they were still willing to fly the spacecraft.\\n\\n I asked them what they had done to check the switch to see if this would happen. The colonel heading the project (and he may have been the commander of the flight test facility) was standing there. He asked, “What are you talking about?” I asked, “Have you run vibration tests or anything like that to see if this could happen?” He asked, “What do you want us to do—tear it apart under vibration?” I said, “No, but this could possibly happen from the vibration of the booster.”\\n\\n The next morning when I came in, two of the young engineers came running in and said, “John, John, you were right, you were right.” The colonel was nowhere to be seen. I told them, “Well, we’ve been flying these rockets for years. You should get the information from us on how to wire your boosters.” Cook Electronics were the people that designed this system for them. They were to use this launch vehicle to test their supersonic drogue parachute. As well as I can remember, Cook had bought the Steinthal Parachute Company [M. Steinthal & Company, Inc.]\\n\\n When I got back to Langley, I went down to Caldwell Johnson’s branch. His people did all of this kind of work for Guy Thibodaux on firing his multiple-stage rockets. I asked for them to give me the drawings of how they did it so that I could send them to Cook. Russell [E.] Clickner asked me if I was talking about Cook Electronics, and I told him, “Yes.” He said, “They have already been in our office, and we showed them how to do it.” So Cook Electronics, in their great wisdom in electronics, had done it their way instead of our way. But I sent the information to them, and as far as I know, they ended up having a successful launch of the boosters, but they were not able to develop a successful supersonic drogue parachute.\\n\\n Bob Gilruth then sent me out to the NACA Flight Test Facility at the Edwards Air Force Base at Muroc, California, to have it dropped in a test vehicle from an F-104 Airplane at Mach number 1.4. Neil [A.] Armstrong, who was a test pilot there, flew the F-104 airplane for us on these tests. We had a failure on the first drop test. The camera showed that the drogue parachute opened and closed at a very high rate of speed and tore itself up. The parachute had a 30-foot-long nylon riser that had high elasticity. We found out that we had to change from a nylon riser to a Dacron™ riser that had much less elasticity. That was successful. I think I told you about seeing Neil Armstrong later here at Houston to receive the Rotary NASA award that we, the Space Center Rotary, presented to him. Did I tell you that story?"

        "utterance": "That’s an interesting story. I am a member of the Space Center Rotary Club. Every year the Space Center Rotary Club gives what they call the NASA/Rotary Award to the outstanding person in aviation and/or space. It was started about eighteen years ago. Owen [G.] Morris, who had worked for NACA and NASA and is a member of Rotary, came up with the idea. He and Charles Hartman were two of the people who implemented this award from Rotary. Dr. Max Faget was the first recipient of the award. Since then, some of the astronauts, congressmen, aircraft executives, and others have received it. They had been trying to give it to Neil Armstrong for many years. Neil, who is a quiet, private kind of person, had kept turning it down. Finally, about three years ago, he came down and accepted the award. The award banquet is held at the Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown Houston. There are at least 700 to 800 people in attendance at the ceremony every year.\\n\\n When I got there, the first two people that I ran into were Bob [Robert F.] Thompson and his wife Dorothy. When I went up to say hello, Bob introduced me to Neil. It was Neil Armstrong. It was the first time that I had ever met him. I shook Neil’s hand, and I asked him, “Neil, do you remember those drop tests on the Mercury drogue parachute at Edwards?” He said, “I sure do.” And he went through this spiel. He recounted some of the problems that he had to face on flying these missions. When he dropped the test vehicle with its drogue parachute from the F-104 airplane, he said that if the parachute worked, they knew where it was going to land. If it did not open, it would keep on going flying at Mach number 1.4. They had to be certain that it would land somewhere in the desert and not on someone. What was interesting about this was that when I talked to Neil Armstrong about it, he went through all this and he had remembered everything. Here was a man who had been a test pilot, had become an astronaut, flew in Gemini, and was the first man to land and step on the Moon. He had done all those great things, and he still remembered that specific test program. I was so impressed with him.\\n\\n It turned out that the first one failed, and it kept on going and landed out in the desert somewhere. They were able to find it and get the camera out of it. We found out that when the parachute was deployed, it opened and closed at such a high rate of speed that it tore itself apart. The riser on the parachute was 30 feet long and made out of nylon which was very elastic. When I reported this to Max, he put Phil Deans on the problem. He ran the calculations that showed that the dynamics of the nylon riser was what was causing it. Well, he worked out the dynamics of it. We put it on a Dacron riser, which was not near as elastic, and it worked. I did not know this at the time, but when Phil was assigned to my section, I assigned him to help me on the parachutes. He had gone to Max and told him that he did not want to work on parachutes because his degree was in aeronautics. Max explained to him that parachutes were aeronautics. I was certainly glad that I had him. Phil became a highly rated and a very successful engineer at the Center.\\n\\n An interesting antidote to that is that when I went out for the second drop test, I carried a Steinthal drogue parachute under my arm. My purpose was to get Radioplane to solve the problem, which they did, with us and Phil Deans working with them. They certainly were not about to let me test the Steinthal parachute. I could have done it too because I was responsible for developing the drogue parachute. We were held responsible for the success or failure of our programs. At that time, we did not have to go through review boards and all of those kinds of things every time we wanted to try something new. We were in a race against the Russians to put a man in space.\\n\\n I now know that Cook Electronics and the Air Force did have a failure, and they did not develop a successful Steinthal parachute at supersonic airspeeds. We at NASA and Radioplane ended up developing the first successful supersonic drogue parachute.\\n\\n It turned out later that when John [H.] Glenn was reentering the atmosphere at transonic speeds, he thought that the capsule was oscillating too much. He said that he thought that he had better push the button and eject the drogue parachute. He said that he reached for the button, but that the parachute came out before he touched it. All of this was happening while the capsule was oscillating, and he had his spacesuit and gloves on. The drogue chute came out, and it survived. I still wonder to this day if John Glenn would have survived if the drogue had not been designed for supersonic speeds.\\n\\n Later on in the Apollo Program, we were going to test the deployment of the triple parachute system with a boilerplate capsule of the Apollo spacecraft out over the Galveston Bay. “Shorty” [John A.] Powers was the first person who was the head of our Public Affairs Office [PAO]. He had one of the best jobs at the Center as head of public relations, which included the astronauts, and he blew it. When Shorty found out about the test, he got a hold of the press and invited them out to observe the test drop the next day. He had not talked to us about it. We were using the same parachutes that we had on the Mercury Program.\\n\\n The following day we were going to fly John Glenn. I told Max about it. I was concerned that they might stop John Glenn’s flight if we had any kind of failure with those parachutes. Max checked it out and found out that we really were not ready to go, and he stopped the drop test. Shorty Powers went in and accused Max of stopping tests because of him and the press. Max told him no, we still had some problems to work out. The next day, after John Glenn had been launched on our first orbital mission, we dropped the capsule, and the test system failed. The parachutes were not deployed. The next day, the headlines in the Houston Post newspaper was, “The Apollo Spacecraft was Stuck in the Mud in Galveston Bay.” That pretty well takes us through developing the drogue parachute."

The evaluation board asked me how I would rate the evaluations of all of the propulsion systems on the spacecraft. I said that it should be about 60 percent of the criteria because they were such a very important part of the whole system. They lowered the evaluation of the propulsion systems to 40 percent of the total criteria. You can see that that was a very important area in the design of the spacecraft.\\n\\n Bill [William] Petynia and I helped Bob [Robert O.] Piland to pull together the results of all of the committee reports for the board’s final review. We knew what findings went on to the board for their final evaluation.\\n\\n The Redstone boosters that we used for the suborbital flights with Alan [B.] Shepard and Virgil [I. “Gus”] Grissom had been developed by Wernher von Braun and his team for the Air Force at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency at Huntsville, Alabama. I found out just a few years ago that in WWII, von Braun had on the drawing board a man in a capsule for a one-way trip to New York City, New York. We could have had a 9/11 [September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center] in World War II if he’d been able to do that. Does that send chills up and down your spine?"

I was in a small group of people who were in the Space Task Group that welcomed the first seven astronauts that came on board. I briefed them on the parachute systems. I told you about Ham [the first chimp in space] and his flight. I talked about the astronauts being willing to risk their lives even after going down to the Cape and watching all those boosters blowing up on the pad. Thank God we never had any of that happen. I talked to you about how Chris [Christopher C.] Kraft was running the launches at the Cape.\\n\\n Before Alan Shepard’s flight, Max called me into the office and asked me to manage one of the three parallel studies of sending man to the Moon so that’s when I left Mercury. It was about the time of the first boilerplate capsule test, but I still watched that with great interest.\\n\\n From those studies we started the Apollo Program. President [John F.] Kennedy was able to say that the United States would go to the Moon in this decade. We hadn’t even put a man in orbit around the Earth when he said that, but the Apollo Program to land a man on the Moon had already been started.\\n\\n That was about the time we moved down here. You probably know this, but what was so interesting was that the site that we built the Center on acreage that [ Humble Oil] Exxon had donated to Rice University. Rice was then able to donate it to the government. Exxon couldn’t do it because it might be considered a bribe, but an educational institution could do it. After we moved down here the government bought additional acreage from Exxon for the Manned Spacecraft Center. Then the Friendswood Development Company, an Exxon subsidiary, built a whole new city, Clear Lake City, around the facility, which is now part of Houston, Texas. Did you know that story?"

        "utterance": "What was so interesting about that was that I was on the Board of Directors of the Citizens State Bank in Dickinson for fourteen years that was owned by Walter Hall. He was a state banker, and he owned five banks around the state. He owned the bank that was the Webster State Bank. What is interesting about this is that when Walter Hall offered me the position, I read the Texas State Manual listing the responsibilities of a director. At that time, when we accepted the responsibilities of an outside business, we had to get approval from the Personnel Office. They would determine if it would be a conflict of interest with my government job. I could not see where that would be a conflict of interest so I sent a memo to the head of personnel who at that time was Stu [Stuart H.] Clarke.\\n\\n He sent me a two-page memo of disapproval. I said to myself, “If I am not able to solve this, Walter probably will not want me on his board.” So I set up a meeting with Stu Clarke and Dr. Gilruth. When Stu handed the memo to Dr. Gilruth, he laid it down on his desk without looking at it. Gilruth asked if he had checked with NASA Headquarters [Washington, DC] on the subject, which he had not done. So Dr. Gilruth had asked him to do so, which he did. Stu Clarke came back with an approval. What he and I did not know was that Dr. Gilruth had already cleared it with NASA Headquarters so that Walter Hall could nominate me for the position. This opened it up so that others at NASA became directors of banks. Joe [Joseph F.] Shea became a director at the La Porte State Bank, and Alan Shepard became a director of a bank in Baytown. These are two who I know of.\\n\\n Walter told me the story that the people in Clear Lake came to him and told him, “We’re going to be annexed by Houston. What can we do to stop it?” He told them, “You need to get together about $250,000.” They told him, “No, we don’t have $250,000.” What a big mistake that was. Clear Lake City was annexed by Houston. Then the Clear Lake area spent millions of dollars later trying to be de-annexed, and they were never successful. If they had listened to him, Clear Lake might have been another city, just like Nassau Bay. Of course, Houston wanted the Space Center to be in Houston and that was a big combination that was hard to beat. That’s a very interesting sidelight I think in the development of the area.\\n\\n When we moved down here from Virginia, we had three different projects going on at the same time: 1) Mercury had flown its suborbital flights, 2) we were cutting the hardware for the two-man Gemini spacecraft, and 3) we had signed a contract for Apollo Command and Service Module [CSM], and we still had to get a contractor for the Lunar Excursion Module [later known as the Lunar Module or LM].\\n\\n Max had said, “I’m going to be down in Houston on the 1st of January. I want you to be down there the 1st of February.” So I was here. I came down here six months before my family moved down. I stayed in the temporary barracks here at Ellington Field that were built in WWI!\\n\\n In addition to flying the flights and all, we still had to build the test facilities, including the Mission Control Center and the Environmental Test Chamber [Space Environment Simulation Laboratory]. That chamber was the largest in the world that could simulate space environment at that time. As far as I know it probably still is. The Apollo contract for the Command and Service Module was the largest contract that the U.S. government had ever written. It was larger than the one for the atom bomb in World War II.\\n\\n When we organized down here, of course Dr. Gilruth became the Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center. Max Faget was made Director of E&D [Engineering and Development Directorate]. Chris Kraft was made Director of FOD [Flight Operations Directorate]. Astronaut Deke [Donald K.] Slayton was made head of the astronauts and Flight Crew Operations [Directorate]. Deke had been diagnosed with a heart condition so he had been taken off of flight status.\\n\\n I think that it was amazing what Dr. Gilruth and his people accomplished during this period of time. We were working 10 to 12 hours a day, sometimes 6 or 7 days a week, and traveling all over the country. We were in a race to beat the Russians to the Moon. It took us awhile to catch up with them.\\n\\n Now you may know this from your other interviews, but in order to go to the Moon, we had to develop the capability to change orbits in space, rendezvous, and dock with other orbiting space vehicles. Our studies on the Apollo showed us that we had to have that capability. During this time the Mission Control Center had been completed in Houston, Texas. Gemini IV was the first flight controlled from the Control Center. I didn’t have anything particular to do with Gemini. It was on Gemini IV when we flew Ed [Edward H.] White.\\n\\n Another anecdote here is that on the first docking of the Gemini spacecraft with the Agena rocket motor, the combination went into a violent uncontrolled spin. They thought it was due to cross-couplings of the two vehicle control systems. Neil Armstrong was the pilot. He undocked from the Agena, but the spacecraft continued to spin at such a high rate of speed. Both of the crew members were about to black out. Neil turned off the RCS [Reaction Control System], and that stopped the capsule from spinning. One of the RCS jets had stuck open. So this saved their lives. That was very close."

        "utterance": "Yes they were. As I have said, I was not working on the Gemini Program. Dr. Faget had made me his technical assistant, the head of the Apollo Project Office for E&D. When Dr. Gilruth started the Center, he brought on board Jim [James C.] Elms in 1963 as his Deputy Director who was an outstanding organizer and manager. He helped Dr. Gilruth to organize the Center. Jim Elms came up with the idea of assigning subsystem managers to the subsystems on the spacecraft. Bob Piland lead a team, which I was part of, which identified the 36 subsystem managers from E&D that were assigned to the Apollo spacecraft. They were later increased to 42. They worked for their divisions and got their instructions and support from the divisions, but I was responsible to Dr. Faget for these subsystem managers. Later, I was made the manager of the Program Support Office. An updated outline of my duties is shown NASA’s position record.\\n\\n I kept Dr. Faget abreast of the subsystem managers’ progress. I would sit on the many review boards that they had to go before while getting ready for flight. What was so interesting about this was that in those days, the subsystem manager had to show that their subsystem was ready to fly. That was part of my job. The division chiefs were also responsible for the technical support that was required.\\n\\n For the Apollo Program, NASA built a new rocket test facility on Merritt Island, later named Cape Kennedy [now Cape Canaveral], Florida, after our late President John F. Kennedy. Now one thing I have never written about was the fire at the Cape. I didn’t want to talk about it. People always wanted to be around the astronauts. They wanted to be seen with them and photographed with them. I could understand that. Based on my World War II experiences, I tried not to get too close to the astronauts because if anything happened to any of them, I knew that it would be hard to handle.\\n\\n But I did have some good friends in the Astronaut Office. I considered Deke Slayton and Alan Shepard good friends. The astronauts were assigned to follow specific subsystems. Alan Shepard was assigned to the parachutes and Gus Grissom to the propulsion systems. Alan called me up one day and said, “Hey John, I’m going out to the Rag Factory.” That is, he was going out to see the parachutes at Radioplane. I think it was PR [public relations] for the company to have an astronaut to come to see them. If I had said, “Okay Al, I’ll go with you,” I probably could have gotten in on some of the first-class treatments that the first seven astronauts were given, but I did not. I was too busy.\\n\\n I did not get close to the astronauts other than in my work. I had not even met Neil Armstrong, and he’d done the drop tests for me. But Neil Armstrong was the one who gave me the [Silver] Snoopy Award. Word must have gotten out to him some way of my responsibilities on Apollo. Needless to say I was very proud of that.\\n\\n Joe Shea was the first Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager. He was responsible for the spacecraft being built by the contractors. His office assigned spacecraft managers that took care of having the spacecraft built at that contractor and shipped to Merritt Island by the contractor. The subsystem managers were held responsible for their subsystems in each spacecraft. Dr. Faget and Joe Shea set up a series of meetings to review the status of the subsystems with his spacecraft managers who worked with the contractors. Dr. Faget and Joe Shea co-chaired those meetings.\\n\\n I was assigned to be secretary of those meetings. We came up with a list of action items that E&D had to do, and those that the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office had to do. I would write those items in the minutes. I also made up a chart to follow these action items so when we would have the next review, I would go over the checklist of each of these items. There was one person from the program office, a Dr. Lee by the way, who never completed his action items. Finally one day at a meeting he asked, “What is it that I have to do to get off that list?” I responded, “You have to solve the problems.” It wasn’t long after that, that he left the Center. I guess he wasn’t used to what he thought was some peon questioning what a doctor should do. That was of the things that I was assigned to do.\\n\\n When I first moved to Houston, I was in an office with Dr. Gilruth and Dr. Faget and some of their staff in the Farnsworth Chambers Building off of Telephone Road. Dr. Gilruth set up Joe Shea with his people in a motel on the Gulf Freeway. I forget what the name of that motel was. Max had a bunch of his engineers in the Rich Building on Telephone Road.\\n\\n I came down here six months before my family did. That was when we were having our house built that my wife and I had designed for the lot that we had bought. I was rooming at Ellington Field with Owen [E.] Maynard from the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office. Dr. Gilruth had hired Jim [James A.] Chamberlin from Canada. He had been working at the AVRO Aircraft Company in Canada that had been dissolved. He came on board with the Space Task Group while we were still at Langley and he brought with him about a dozen of their best engineers. Jim Chamberlin was a top engineer. Owen Maynard was in this group of very good engineers.\\n\\n At that time we did not even know what the Moon was made of. Owen would bring drawings of the LEM [Lunar Excursion Model] home [the barracks] with him at night. At that time we were trying to decide how to design the lunar landing system on the LEM. Should it have four legs or three? Whether or not it should have spikes that would go down into the ground or whether it should have pads on the bottom, and those kinds of things. One night Owen Maynard put his pencil down, and he said, “Damn, just think, the decisions we’re making today can affect the astronauts’ lives ten years from now.” Wasn’t that a scary thought?\\n\\n I think you asked about the fire at the Cape, and I had never put that in my memoirs or my presentations. I think I did talk to you yesterday about Dr. Faget and Phil Deans investigating it at the Cape, and that I sat on the review board here with Aaron Cohen on the questions that were being sent to the Center from the Cape. Then after the fire at the Cape, Joe Shea was relieved by George [M.] Low, who at that time was Dr. Gilruth’s Assistant Director. Low stepped down from that position to take over the Apollo Program. George Low did a magnificent job.\\n\\n We talked about the Apollo 8 [Frank] Borman crew, and that I was the lead engineer from E&D on the team that helped determine the status of the subsystems and the upgrades that would be needed, if any, so that we could go to the Moon.\\n\\n I was taking care of the subsystem managers for both contractors. The job became so large that I had Dr. Faget assign Phil Deans to take care of the LEM at the Grumman Aircraft Company. Later, I brought Bob [Robert P.] Burt onboard to monitor the North American contract. With their help, I would coordinate the subsystem managers’ progress for both contractors.\\n\\n On the Apollo Program, instead of supporting the engineering part of it, I was put on the management committee representing E&D. That was my part on the evaluation committee for the Apollo CSM contract. Bill Petynia and I also helped Bob Piland pull together the committee reports to be sent to the board. So I got to see all aspects of the engineering sides of the evaluation.\\n\\n I was not involved in any of the work on the engineering facilities or the Mission Control Center. With the help of Jim Chamberlin, I helped set up the E&D part of the Mission Evaluation Room.\\n\\n I have told you about my mixed emotions when I was first with von Braun and his staff at the MSFC. Later on in the Apollo Program, Dr. Gilruth had George Low host Dr. von Braun and his staff from MSFC along with KSC [Kennedy Space Center, Florida] and NASA Headquarters on a tour of the MSC facilities. I was put in charge of the E&D divisions’ presentations to MSFC. After the tour, I was commended in front of our guests by George Low for a job well done, which I thought was very nice of him, but the divisions were the ones that deserved the credit. I also received a letter from Dr. Gilruth.\\n\\n I have to say this. There were a number occasions where we had to change von Braun’s ideas around. When we flew the Skylab Program, I was working on a design for a Space Station. von Braun had proposed a Space Station design as a big wheel in space to simulate artificial gravity because they thought that the astronauts would have problems in zero gravity. In the Skylab, we found out that we didn’t have to have artificial gravity.\\n\\n Dr. von Braun proposed going all the way to the Moon with one booster rocket and to bring the spacecraft back from the Moon. That would have been a monster. It wouldn’t have worked. Because of the work that we had done at Wallops Island on staging of the booster rockets, Max Faget convinced him that staging was the way to go. I saw the history of von Braun on TV, and they gave him credit for staging in going to the Moon. I know that he had a little help there.\\n\\n The other was that later on, after Apollo, we ran two competing studies between the two Centers on the design of the Space Station. The study at our Center was managed by Rene [A.] Berglund. I was his deputy and the chief engineer from E&D. We would meet with MSFC staff on each of these studies. The studies had two different approaches. We proposed solar arrays for our power supply in Earth orbit, but MSFC went with atomic energy for their power supply. It was determined that solar arrays were best for Earth orbit. Atomic energy could be used for flights outside of Earth orbit so it turned out that we beat them on that.\\n\\n When I would work with my counterpart over there, we would come to an agreement on what we should do. I’d come back and present it to Dr. Gilruth and Dr. Faget, and they would agree with it. The manager at MSFC would present it to von Braun and his staff. Then I would find out that no, Marshall had changed or knocked out certain things. They were very hard to work with. You couldn’t seem to get agreements with them, but we ended up beating them on every turn.\\n\\n I think that they knew liquid propulsion, and I won’t argue with that because I don’t know too much about it. They were not experts on solid fuel rocket motors. For some reason, they were given the responsibility on the solid rocket motors on the Shuttle. I think it was a political decision. This was proven when they had the O-ring problem on a Shuttle flight [STS 51-L, Space Shuttle Challenger accident]. Guy Thibodaux is a world-wide expert in both solid fuel rocket and in liquid propulsion. I firmly believe that Guy and his people would have recognized the problem, and the Challenger explosion would not have happened.\\n\\n Those were some of my experiences with Marshall. Those were some that come to mind right away. It was hard to work with Marshall. I think if you talked to Caldwell Johnson, he would tell you how hard it was because he worked with them more than I did.\\n\\n When we heard that NASA planned to go to the Moon after the first manned flight of the program [Apollo 7], thoughts were, that was great! It was a real bold idea. We jumped right in and went to work on the upgrades. I don’t remember specifically from subsystem to subsystem what some of the upgrades were that we had to make. I passed the action items from Aaron Cohen on to the subsystem managers and they, with their divisions, took care of them.\\n\\n I will discuss some people that I was personally involved in. Jim Chamberlin was an outstanding engineer. He was the Gemini program manager, and he got the Spacecraft built at the contractor. When the spacecraft became operational, Chuck [Charles W.] Mathews was made the program manager. So, for a while, Jim was free-ranging around the Center. He was writing Gilruth all these memos about the problems that he thought there were on the Apollo spacecraft, so Dr. Faget talked Dr. Gilruth into putting Jim Chamberlin under him because what Jim was talking about were Dr. Faget’s responsibilities. Max walked into my office one day and said, “John, I’m bringing Jim Chamberlin on board. You’re to take care of him for me.” I said, “Well thanks a lot.”\\n\\n I knew that Jim had a reputation of being hard to work with. I found out that he was a very brilliant man. He had a personality where he would get under people’s skin. My first experience with him was on the Mercury Program. He got it set up so that we could go out to McDonnell in St. Louis [Missouri] and work with our counterparts on Mercury. These were the days before the subsystem managers. My counterparts were Jim Mazzonie on the propulsion systems and Johnnie Whitecamp on the parachute systems. One day I got a call from Jim Mazzonie, and he told me that Jim Chamberlin had been out there and had changed one of our agreements. I went immediately into Jim Chamberlin’s office and asked him why he had done that. He had a sheepish grin and said that he was checking to see how well and fast the system would work. He seemed pleased how fast it had worked with me. The next time that we were at McDonnell for a big staff review, Jim Mazzonie told the staff that I had never steered him wrong. I thought that was a very nice compliment.\\n\\n Jim Chamberlin had the ability to get to the meat of the problem. He would get two people in a room, and they would be discussing the same problem, but they had different ways of doing it. He would ask one what he wanted to do, and then ask the second person what he wanted to do. If one guy seemed to be winning, he would work with the other person and help build him up a little bit more. Then the other person would say something that he really did not want to say about what his problems were. The real problems that a person did not want to talk about would somehow sift out onto the table. That was one of the ways that he worked with people.\\n\\n He made me a co-chairman on his ad hoc committee. We were investigating problems that we were having with hardware and software that were going to the Moon. I wrote the minutes for these meetings, and I would chair the meetings when he was not there. Those minutes would go to Dr. Gilruth, Dr. Faget, and Flight Operations so they all knew what we were doing.\\n\\n In some cases E&D was designing things without knowing what the actual criteria were, such as operations, and for the proper Moon environment, and those kinds of things. We found out that the Crew Systems Division had taken the responsibility for the VOX [voice operated transmitter] Communications System, [it was voice-activated] because it was in the astronauts’ helmet. We turned VOX Systems responsibility over to Ralph [S.] Sawyers’ Electronics Systems Division responsible for electronics.\\n\\n The Crew Systems Division also did not know what the criteria were for designing the astronauts’ helmet to be used on the Moon’s surface. We made certain that the right people had the right responsibilities and the right design criteria. Oh, and by the way, one of the people who was on the committee representing the astronauts was Ken [Thomas K.] Mattingly, so I got to know him pretty well.\\n\\n When Frank Borman and his crew came out from behind the Moon for the first time, you could hear them just like they were in the next room. I was elated. It was a beautiful sound. Jim’s committee helped us to solve those kinds of problems. As far as I know, the astronauts did not have any trouble with their helmets from the Moon’s environment. Those were some of the things that we did. I also received a letter of appreciation from Lt. General Sam Phillips on my contributions to the Apollo 8 mission.\\n\\n As well as I can remember, I was in the viewing room at the Mission Control Center when [the Apollo 8 crew spoke to the American people]. It was just a great thrill, and it sounded like they were in the next room.\\n\\n We were always continuing to get ready for the next. We were also having reviews of the subsystems and the writing of the post launch reports on Apollo 8. I guess this is the place to review some of the things that we have already talked about. George Low, who was then the head of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, set up what was called the Mission Evaluation Room [MER] in Building 45. It was headed up by the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office. It included the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office’s lead engineer and the engineers from the contractors as well as E&D with their 36 subsystem managers and their contractor counterparts. I was the lead engineer from E&D for the subsystem managers and their support. There were about 100 people around the clock. I would head up one shift for eight hours and Phil Deans and Bob Burt would run the other two eight-hour shifts. That was carried out through all of the Apollo flights. When the explosion happened in the Apollo 13 Service Module, we [E&D], within eight hours, told Flight Control what had happened to the spacecraft, and how they could use the LM as a life boat to save the crew and the spacecraft.\\n\\n [Before the Apollo 11 launch,] I had received the [Silver] Snoopy award from Neil Armstrong which was a big thrill. I hadn’t even met the man. Dr. Faget had picked Aleck [C.] Bond and me for the Manned Flight Awareness Award which included a trip to Cape Kennedy for the Apollo 11 launch. I had grown up flying rocket models off of Wallops Island, observing the test of the Little Joe boiler plate rocket model at White Sands, and the Big Joe boiler plate at the Cape. Even I was not ready for the Apollo 11 launch. I saw grown men crying when that baby took off. Of course when it landed on the Moon, I was also very elated. You know how close that they were of running out of fuel. Everyone was elated when Neil Armstrong said, “Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.” When Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon my father called me. He was very proud that his son worked on the space program.\\n\\n I was at home [when the Apollo 13 accident happened]. I was the president of the Dickinson Country Club. It ended up that all of a sudden I was both secretary and treasurer. The next year I became the president of country club. As president I helped to put the country club back on its feet, but that is another story. I was holding a board of directors meeting in my home, when I got a call from Phil Deans who was on the second shift. He told me that something had happened to the spacecraft but we didn’t know yet what it was. I knew immediately that it was probably very serious. When I finished the meeting, I told the board members that I would be out of pocket for a while, which I was.\\n\\n I thought [the Movie, Apollo 13,] was a very good film, but it was not a documentary. It could not cover everything that happened in detail. A good example of that was that a number of things, such as energy conservation, were lumped together under Ken Mattingly. It was pretty accurate on what had happened but not necessarily who had done them.\\n\\n Dr. Faget asked me to be the deputy manager and lead engineer to design a Space Station while he was designing the Space Shuttle. This was done under Dr. Faget’s Advanced Design Group headed up by Rene Berglund. We designed a Space Station using the Saturn booster, but President [Richard M.] Nixon had cancelled the booster, which was a big, big, mistake. Then we had to design it to be put up with the Shuttle. You saw the model of it upstairs, yesterday. That was the concept that we developed back in the early 1970s, and we had to put it on the shelf because we didn’t have the money to develop both at the same time. I also went through an iteration on an Earth Operational Space Station under Bob Piland, which was a better design of what I showed you yesterday. That was also cancelled which was also a bad deal.\\n\\n I was also the lead engineer from E&D under Rene Berglund to develop the Apollo-Soyuz docking concept. The objective of Apollo-Soyuz Test Project [ASTP] was to test the compatibility of rendezvous and docking of the American and Soviet spacecraft and to open the way to international space rescue as well as future joint man flights. [Artist concept of Apollo-Soyuz Docked]\\n\\n Glynn [S.] Lunney, who had been a lead flight controller, was made the project manager. The Apollo Command Module and Soyuz docked on July 17th of 1975. Deke Slayton was on that flight.\\n\\n Here is an interesting antidote. We went over to Huntsville, Alabama, for a staff meeting with von Braun and his people. Coming back, we would have to fly from Huntsville to Atlanta [Georgia], change planes to go to New Orleans [Louisiana], and then on to Houston. It was not an easy trip and very time consuming so von Braun gave us his Grumman twin engine jet airplane, the Gulfstream, to fly directly to Houston. He was going to send us back on that.\\n\\n When we took off down the runway, all of a sudden there was a loud explosion. Boom!! Guy Thibodaux had just laid back in his seat, and this projectile came through the door right by his head, hit the ceiling in the aisle over my head, and dropped onto the floor. Stuff came falling down from the ceiling and burned holes in my pants. I jumped up, and I stomped on it one time. I realized that I was stomping on a red-hot piece of metal. Chris [C.] Critzos was there. He was an assistant to Dr. Chris Kraft in Operations. We threw some magazines on top of it, then he got a fire extinguisher and he sprayed it. This was during takeoff. The pilot was able to stop the plane before it ran off the end of the runway.\\n\\n Chris Critzos wrote up an accident report on it. He talked about a fire in the cabin. I don’t remember any fire. This red hot piece of metal dropped right down beside me, and I pulled my right leg over like that and it just missed my leg, but burning flakes came sprinkling down from the ceiling, and burned holes in my pants. That was a close call, but it was something."

        "utterance": "Okay. Well, I was raised in Bakersfield [California]. When I started high school, I had no plans of being an engineer. When I started high school, I was twelve years old, and this was back in 1946, so at that time girls were either going to be nurses, teachers or secretaries, and that was basically my thought. I started out thinking I was going to be a secretary.\\n\\n Because I loved math, I was taking math courses as electives. I finally, because I wanted to be with my friends, I was taking classes with a lot of kids who were going on to college, so I switched my major to math and science. I started at Bakersfield College. I majored in physics, physics and math.\\n\\n Again, physics was my favorite science when I was in high school. But at that time physics, the beginning physics, is really mechanics. It’s really the basis for engineering. I should have gone into engineering at that time, but when I started college, now, this was in 1950, and we really didn’t have very good counseling. It just never entered anyone’s mind to suggest that I go into engineering. So I went ahead and went on to [University of California] Berkeley and got a degree in physics and math.\\n\\n I started working at NACA in the summer after I graduated from Bakersfield College. It wasn’t a coop program, I just worked the two summers there as like an aide. It was Mr. [DeElroy E.] Beeler, De Beeler from Dryden, came out to Bakersfield College and interviewed us. Actually, there were a group of us, and we were interviewed by the Navy at China Lake and the Air Force at Edwards Air Force Base and NASA, which was NACA then.\\n\\n To show you or just to give you an idea of how the times were then, we all filled out the same applications, and the offer that I got back from Edwards Air Force Base was to come in and take a typing test, and none of the guys were. I mean, they were all offered jobs as engineering aides. That was the mind-set back in those days.\\n\\n So I chose to work for NASA, NACA, primarily because they offered me one grade higher than China Lake did. I started out a GS-4. When I first came to the Edwards, I was put in an office with a bunch of women, and they called us computers. The guys that came were put into various engineering offices and were given jobs as engineering aides. So they really were given more of, in my view, a growth opportunity. They all worked on various projects.\\n\\n As a computer, I just did routine math work, and I mean routine. I really believed at the time I could have done it with about a fifth-grade education. I did a lot of work on a Friden calculator. We read film, the oscillograph traces on film. We had little rulers, and we measured in inches and then we’d go to a chart, a calibration chart.\\n\\n Roxanah [B. Yancey], Roxy, was the head computer, and she would give us these sheets of paper with columns. One column would be for the inches that we read off the film. Another column would be whatever that was in degrees, pounds, whatever. Then there would be a lot of mathematical calculations, and she had on the top of each column “column one times column two” or whatever. And I’d just sit for hours at the Friden calculator multiplying column one times column two and so forth. So I really did not find that job very challenging.\\n\\n So at the end of the second summer, they asked me [if] I [was] interested in coming back and so forth. In this office of computers, there were women who had just high school educations and then there were some who had college degrees, and they all did the same work. And by this time I had discovered that a lot of the engineers did not have degrees in engineering, they had degrees in various sciences, including physics. So I thought, well, gee, I really felt like I would be happier working as an engineer.\\n\\n So I told them, and they said fine. If I’m not mistaken, at the end of that second summer they actually transferred me into an engineering office. I know when I came back as a graduate, then I was assigned to an engineering project.\\n\\n But as far as any interest in aviation, if the person who had recruited me at Bakersfield College had been a civil engineer, I probably would have been a civil engineer. I was never at any time in my education ever given any real counseling. I realized as a senior, when I was taking the kind of physics that you take as a senior, that that wasn’t what I wanted at all, but even then I didn’t think I had the luxury of changing majors, because, for one thing, I didn’t have a lot of support from my family. I was the first one to go to college. So I didn’t feel like I could change majors at that point. I had to just press on. I got the degree in physics. It wasn’t until much later that I went back to graduate school and got degrees in engineering.\\n\\n Well, why don’t I stop here and let you—"

        "utterance": "Well, actually, at the end of my second summer, I actually went on leave. In other words, I was a government employee in my senior year in college, which actually helped me later. So there was no big transition. I just came back. The only thing was the pay was a little higher, but not much.\\n\\n I can still remember exactly what my paycheck was. When I was a summer student, my paycheck, after everything was taken out, was $94.07 for two weeks. Now, that included my room was taken out of that. We stayed in dormitories, and the cost of the dormitory was $3.46 a week, $7.92—no—yes, $6.92 for two weeks. That was taken out of my paycheck.\\n\\n So the only thing I had to buy was food and any entertainment, which was very little on the base. Movies were a quarter. We could go bowling for a quarter. So everything was pretty cheap. So, out of the $94.07, I managed to save $70.00 every two weeks to put toward my education.\\n\\n When I came back after I got the degree, my check was $97.56. [Laughs] Big pay raise. But part of the reason it was so small is that at this point I was having civil service retirement taken out, rather than social security. At that time social security was very small. But anyway, that was my paycheck for two weeks.\\n\\n I didn’t have any real expense those summers when I worked there because I didn’t have a car. Roxy was given the use of a government car to take us to work, because we lived right there on the base and it wasn’t very far. The second summer, I guess, for some reason they took that away from her, but then she bought a car. I always managed to get a ride with somebody, so I didn’t have any car expenses.\\n\\n When I graduated, of course, then I did get a car, and that’s when I realized that I really didn’t make a lot of money. [Laughs] Summers it seemed like that was a lot, and that was. This is another thing. Most of that time I sort of compared myself with other girls, and I made a lot of money that summer compared to what the other girls could make. And even after I came to work as an engineer, even though it wasn’t very much, and later on I didn’t make the kind of money that the guys—they got better promotions than I did, it was part of that culture at that time, that kind of a mind-set with me that I wasn’t aggressive. I don’t know if you can understand that."

        "utterance": "I really didn’t have a mentor at that time, and I was the only woman that worked there as an engineer. There was a woman engineer there that first summer, and she got married and left. So when I first came there, I was the only woman. The office that I was put in working with the engineers, it was on the X-3 Program, the engineer, one particular engineer, used me as his private computer. I mean, I was doing a lot of the same work that I had done as a computer, but of course I was doing it on my own projects, which made it a little more interesting, but then he had me do his calculations and everything, too. I don’t think that would have happened if I had been a man.\\n\\n I don’t think I had the kind of assignments, and I didn’t really know what I wanted. Again, like I said, I had no real interest in aviation at that time. It was something that just kind of grew later. But I didn’t really know what I wanted.\\n\\n Women at that time were expected to get married. The men, the management there, expected that, too. In fact, John [Smith] reminded me of one situation where one of the women there, Katharine [H.] Armistead, who was up for promotion and she didn’t get it. Her supervisor explained to her that there was only a certain amount of money available for promotions, and the guys there had families, and it was more important that they got the promotions. They were open about it at that time. That was before the equal rights and all that. So the fact that I didn’t get the kind of promotions and the assignments and so forth, I didn’t complain. So I can’t really blame the men, the management there. I mean, I was part of that same culture."

As my daughter was growing up, most of my interest was in my family. So it wasn’t until she got older. She went to college at the same time I went back to college, and so that was kind of nice.\\n\\n But then when I got back from college and went into project engineering, I first was an F-15 project engineer and then I got the opportunity to be the F-14 project manager.

I wasn’t really involved in a program closely until I got in with the Lifting Body Program. But before that, I calculated flow fields around the X-15, but I wasn’t part of the X-15 project. I did a lot of calculations of aerodynamic coefficients on different shaped wings, a lot of that kind of thing. Because I was probably better than the average engineer at that time in math, they gave me a lot of that kind of thing to do. But it also kept me out of sort of the mainstream of the projects. So that, I think, hindered me as far as getting ahead, because, well, I felt a lot of times somewhat isolated.\\n\\n When I started working on the Lifting Body project, that was kind of a fun thing to do. I have to tell you, I’ll give you another example of sort of the prejudice against women at that time. When I was working on the Lifting Body, Bikle, Paul [F.] Bikle, was the director there and he was a real male chauvinist. He said that women could not go out in the hangar because it bothered the men. So I had to have all of my liaisons with the technicians and the mechanics and so forth, I had to go through one of the other men engineers.\\n\\n At one time I had a problem. I was doing some work with getting aerodynamic coefficients, and I was having a problem with the data. It just didn’t look right. The side slip seemed off. So I asked him if he wouldn’t please have them calibrate it again. He came back, and he said, “Well, they calibrated it once. There’s nothing wrong with it.” But anyway, he went ahead and did it, and still I couldn’t figure it out.\\n\\n So finally I told him, I says, “It just looks like there’s about a three-degree shift in this.”\\n\\n He looked at me kind of funny and he says, “Well, didn’t you know the boom was set off three degrees?”\\n\\n I said, “No. Nobody told me this.”\\n\\n See, this is the kind of thing by not being able to work directly with the technicians, that was kind of a hindrance."

Paul Bikle decided, I guess to save money, he was going to have all the women wait tables, all the women, including the engineers.\\n\\n Bertha [M.] Ryan was there at the time, and she knew Paul Bikle personally. So she went to him, and she said, “You know, I’m kind of clumsy.” She said, “I’m liable to spill soup all over this guy and then later have to work with him in a professional capacity, and he won’t take me seriously.”\\n\\n So Paul Bikle thought about it and decided she was right.

They wanted somebody preferably with a project background. So they asked NASA to—well, the reason they did, in Congress the Republicans at that time were the minority, and the senior minority person on each committee gets one staff person.\\n\\n Barry Goldwater, Jr., was the Republican on this committee, and his staffer was leaving. The committee didn’t really want him to hire somebody else because he wasn’t going to be there very long. So they said, “Why don’t we go to NASA and get just somebody to fill in, just a detail.” So they asked Dryden. So there were several of us applied for it.\\n\\n The management at Ames was in charge of narrowing it down, and they narrowed it down to two of us. We went back and were interviewed by the congress people, the staffers and the congressmen, and I was selected.

We were assigned people, and that was it, and we did the best we could with all we had.\\n\\n We did have money, a budget. I was able to get a travel budget, my own travel budget. I think I was the first one that ever got my own travel budget. NASA was very strict on their travel, and the NASA travel office kept it. This was the F-14 Program, was a joint program with the Navy. I was able to get the Navy to give me a pot of money for travel."

I enjoyed doing it, but like I said, it was not part of the mainstream.\\n\\n Then I got into—we were doing a lot of derivative calculations using flight data and some programs that were developed.

We all agreed that there was nothing that really needed to be changed. So we had a little bet that we could finally get this through this guy. We couldn’t. He had to make one little change.\\n\\n So when I wrote this paper on the wake vortex, it was going to be just a technical memorandum [TM], so it didn’t really need the kind of scrutiny that a report would get. I mean, they were published in-house there at Dryden. So I wrote it and I typed it myself at home. Now, this is before I had a word processor. I had an electric typewriter. I typed it all at home. I brought it to my boss, and he had a bunch of changes.\\n\\n So I went back, made the changes, went home and typed it all up again, and brought it back to him. He went over it and had a few more changes.\\n\\n I said, “Now, this is okay?”\\n\\n He says, “Yeah.”\\n\\n So I went back and typed it all up, and then I took it into the editorial office.

I made all the changes.”\\n\\n So she went ahead and made whatever changes she needed. They typed it up and published it.

I said, “You know, that’s it.” [Laughs] And he was a little irritated.\\n\\n I did this. I had this whole thing out like in a couple of weeks after the data was in.

I retired in ‘89, and I probably would have stayed on, but Congressman Luhan—this was in the fall of [19]‘88 when George [H. W.] Bush was elected president. I also worked on his committee. He had a committee to advise him in space matters, and I was on that committee, which was kind of fun. I helped him to write one of his speeches, just a little piece of it.\\n\\n Let’s see. Where was I? Oh, I was going to say why I didn’t stay on. When he was elected, Congressman Luhan was a very close personal friend of George Bush’s, and he was about to retire from the Congress, so he went to work for Bush. He was the Secretary of the Interior. Congressman [Robert S.] Walker then became the ranking Republican.\\n\\n His staff person then, who was going to be the director of the committee’s Republican staff, he had been the space subcommittee staffer. So he and I were always sort of at each other’s throats, because he worked for the subcommittee ranking Republican and I worked for the committee Republican. We didn’t get along at all, so I was out of there.\\n\\n I mean, once he became the staffer and Congressman Walker was the ranking Republican, I no longer had a job in that committee, I mean as far as Republicans. I was offered a job by the chairman of the committee, who was a Democrat, and he liked me, and he wanted me to stay on as his staffer. But it just happens I am a dyed-in-the-wool Republican. It was probably a coincidence that I went over to work on the Republican staff, but I really fit in there. I just didn’t feel real comfortable working with a Democratic staff.\\n\\n I was old enough then to retire, or I would be. I turned fifty-five in March, and so the ranking Republican let me stay on until March so that I could retire without having to take a cut."

You really do work as a team.\\n\\n On the F-14, we were able to modify the control system so that they wouldn’t lose airplanes in spins. But again, my personal involvement was small. I mean, I was the project manager, but there were a lot of engineers that did the kind of development work on the control system.\\n\\n One of the things I did when I was working for Congress that I thought was kind of interesting, but in the end it failed, as a Republican staffer, you really don’t have an awful lot of clout. All you can do is kind of affect things at the margins. You work with the Democratic staff, and if they are absolutely hell-bent to get something through, I mean, there’s nothing you can do about it. But you can kind of persuade them to maybe to make some changes.\\n\\n But I also learned that sometimes you can kind of work behind the scenes. The Democratic staffer on this aviation subcommittee, he had a bunch of people that he selected to kind of advise him, people from industry. One of the programs that NASA Dryden wanted to work on was the oblique wing. It was an Ames development. They had had a small-scale version that they flew at Dryden, but they wanted to modify—what was the airplane they were going to modify?"

Laundry facilities, we had our own washer and dryer there at the base. I mean, it was kind of a dormitory. It had two wings, and in each wing was a kitchen and a big bathroom. Where the two wings came together, there was like a big common living room. The bedrooms themselves were quite small.\\n\\n Most of our social life really was playing bridge, watching TV, that sort of thing. We did go bowling, went to movies. There were a lot of guys there, but I don’t know that we really ever dated any of them. The facilities, the two summers that I worked there, we were in like in a Quonset hut next to a hangar. It was very kind of spartan.\\n\\n You talked about breaks. Break time, we didn’t really have a break time. Roxanah Yancey was a real taskmaster. At that time when I first went to work there, I never drank coffee, but the only break we got was walking out to the hangar once in the morning and once in the afternoon to get a cup of coffee, because the guys in the hangar had a big urn, and they made the coffee, and they sold it for a nickel a cup.\\n\\n So by drinking coffee, I was able to get a little walk, just to walk into the hangar. I usually went with one of the other women. We’d just chat and walk down there and get a cup of coffee and very slowly stroll back, and that was our break. As I said, I learned to drink coffee.\\n\\n Dress code, I don’t remember them ever giving us a specific dress code. We all wore dresses. It wasn’t until much later that several of us decided to be very brave and we started wearing pantsuits. In fact, we had a group of us women got together and decided to do it all at once, because we knew it was going to cause a stir. [Laughs] But there was no written dress code, to my knowledge. It’s just that we knew we had to wear dresses.\\n\\n The hours that we worked when I was a computer there, we worked eight hours a day. My family lived in Bakersfield, and I usually got a ride. One of the guys, there was a group of guys that worked there, too. I usually rode back to Bakersfield with them on the weekends and then come back.\\n\\n In fact, the earthquake was during—I don’t know if you remember or if you’ve heard about this big earthquake in 1952?"

Apparently you don’t feel much in a car, but he did remember seeing sparks and stuff on the telephone poles.\\n\\n Well, the drive, we had to drive right through Tehachapi and Arvin, and all that area. It was one road. It was kind of around a mountain, and the outside lane had caved in, and we just drove along the inside lane. We were young, stupid. They closed the road right after that, but, see, we went through just right after it happened.\\n\\n We were late getting to work that Monday morning because Tehachapi was all messed up, and we had to go take side streets around.

I want something more challenging.”\\n\\n So one day she said to me, “Mr. Beeler would like to see you.” De. I think we all went by first names. She said, “De would like to see you.”\\n\\n So I went in. Now, I was very shy. De Beeler was a very stern sort of a guy. I went in and I sat down at this table. It seemed to me, thinking back years later, that it must have been just a long table with me at one end and him sitting at his desk at the other end. He didn’t say a word. I sat there thinking, “What does he want?” I thought I was going to get reprimanded or something.\\n\\n Finally he looked up and he said, “What do you want?”\\n\\n And I said, “Well, Roxy said you wanted to see me.”\\n\\n “Oh, yeah.” He said, “I understand you want something more challenging to do.” So he gave me this basically a calculus problem in integration. He said, “Here, do this,” or something like that. He told me the guys that wanted this done. There was an office of guys, and apparently they had been reviewing a Langley paper, and they had these equations in there, and they were integral equations. They had gone through them, and they all got a different answer than what was in the report, and so they were all convinced that the report was wrong. They were on the verge of writing back to Langley saying, “You made a mistake.” But they happened to mention it to De, I guess, and he thought, “Well, Harriet wants something to do. Let her check this.”\\n\\n Well, I did it, and I gave them the answer, and they looked at it. Then pretty soon some other guys came over. They all were leaning over the table looking at it, because I had gotten the same answer that the Langley paper had. [Laughs]"

So, now we’d like to start by going into the other Apollo missions, and then we’ll move on to Apollo-Soyuz [Test-Project (ASTP)] and Skylab, if you want to. Or we can go into Space Station. But we’ll get to those things one small step at a time. So, let’s begin with the other Apollo missions. [Apollo] 7 was the first manned flight, and it came after the Apollo 1 [AS-204] fire. Was there any warning that Apollo, before that fire, perhaps was an accident waiting to happen? Did anybody really catch up to the facts of life in the program?"

And frankly, I think we had been somewhat lulled into a sense of security, or at least a sense of not quite so hazardous on the subject of pure oxygen because of the Gemini experience. We had done it over and over again on the pad in Gemini, and we just hadn’t run into any kind of problem. And because I think we didn’t recognize it for the hazard that it really was, there was also a commensurate lack of attention to the flammable materials in the cockpit. And those things combined with a electrical short of some kind—that is, an ignition source—to give us the fire that we had on Apollo. And in retrospect, it was in front of us; and there it was. And, it—it just had something we had gotten used to and didn’t recognize it for the danger that it was."

And the idea was to keep the spacecraft at an ambient pressure so you won’t get any leaks in from the outside, but rather that it was slightly above the ambient pressure of the—of the outside world. But it was pure oxygen, as we had flown in the Gemini Program, and that is what really produced the environment in which a combination of an ignition source, like a spark, and then some flammable material, and in that kind of environment, it just burned like crazy."

Some people, I believe, had been concerned about that. I recall some discussion that said North American Aviation had—identified that as something to be concerned about. But it never did seem to get, you know, total visibility as the kind of hazard that—it really was. And it came and bit us.\\n\\n The other context for your question, that I thought you might be getting at, is that: In building the Apollo spacecraft, the early ones had a lot of difficulty in the test phase. I mean, it was a—it was a new contractor, North American Aviation. He was building a very advanced spacecraft for the time. And I remember a lot of the tests that were conducted were difficult in the—in that things would go wrong, the test would have to hold, the crews would get frustrated, and so on. And there was a bit of that kind of environment also.\\n\\n And the problem with that is that it induces people to try to solve the problems and get on with it. And, therefore, they probably did not want to spend too much time or consider all the other risks that might not have been identified; such as the pure O2 environment. And it just wasn’t dealt with as a real hazardous condition."

        "utterance": "Oh no. It was—quite advanced. We used—of course, it was much bigger all around. But we used fuel—well, we had fuel cells. I take it back. We had fuel cells in the Gemini spacecraft. But it [Apollo] was considerably bigger. All of the systems that it had onboard were larger, a bigger capacity. It had three crewmembers. And so on. Designed to do something entirely different than the Gemini spacecraft was designed to do. And—therefore, it represented a big step up for us.\\n\\n I would say one other thing about the Apollo spacecraft, especially the command service module [CSM]. When we flew Gemini, if you remember, we went through flights where we had just multiple problems. We had problems with the—fuel cells liked to flood. I don’t know if you remember that, but the fuel cells would kind of back up a little bit and start taking water. And we were always on the verge of having a problem with our power supply with those fuel cells. We also had a lot of problems with thrusters in that they would clog and—the combustion chamber and the igniters would clog, and then we wouldn’t have—we’d have to shut a couple of them down. Usually, I can’t recall the statistics, but on Gemini flights, we generally lost thrusters—several, certainly in the early flights, on each flight.\\n\\n When we got to Apollo, for example, the point is that those systems worked very well. I mean, we didn’t have much in the way of a fuel cell problems. We didn’t have much in the way of thruster problems. We didn’t have any problem with the big engine, the service propulsion system [SPS]. It was a model of reliability. So, besides the larger scale and the more complexity that was built into the Apollo spacecraft, I think the industry in the country had made a significant step up in terms of building high—a better quality from the lessons that were learned in Gemini and the general maturing that was going on in space hardware throughout the industry in the country. We really benefited from quite an improved reliability and operability of the Apollo spacecraft. But in the beginning, you know, the first few articles—when they were trying to take those through the test phases—it was difficult for people. It was difficult."

And it was a bit of a condition that was in the program at that time in that Apollo was a big step, a lot of complicated equipment onboard, and it was difficult to make it work first time out. Actually, in a kind of a way that’s sad, the Apollo fire probably contributed to not only the time, but perhaps a renewed sense of attention. And I don’t mean to say that people weren’t paying attention before. But a different kind of attention, perhaps, was applied to the Apollo spacecraft hardware. And it paid off. It paid off in that during the Apollo flights, Earth orbit, and going to the Moon, for the most part—except for Apollo 13—for the most part, the command service module performed extremely well."

        "utterance": "Well, if you remember at the time, we had the goal of landing on the Moon before the decade was out, and the fire in 1967 was running us pretty close, because we were experiencing a severe setback with the fire. And there wasn’t that much time left between then and the end of the decade. So, I would say that people put—I don’t want to—I don’t know if I’d call it “heroic,” but let’s use that word—a heroic effort into the recovery from the fire and getting the program back on track. I think that was true, certainly, in the command service module—in the command module [CM], where we had the fire. But I think it permeated the rest of the system.\\n\\n I think it permeated the lunar module [LM], because a lot of the things then changed in the lunar module. It also permeated, I think, the launch vehicle development program, the software, the ground systems. People just came back to work with a renewed sense of dedication and kind of a, “I don’t want that to happen again, and I certainly don’t want it to happen in the area that I’m working on, that I’m responsible for.” So, I think a tremendous amount of rededication went on during those months after the fire.\\n\\n At first it was probably strongly flavored by guilt. I think everybody felt like that, “Gee, there might’ve been something that I personally could’ve done to have avoided that.” I think people felt that throughout the program. And then they gradually turned that guilt into a pressure, a motivation, to get things done not only correctly but even better than they had been done before. And it turned out to be a very powerful motivating factor.\\n\\n I don’t know if we talked about this the last time, but Frank [F.] Borman, I think, performed a tremendous service for the program. Somehow or another, and I don’t know who made the selection, he was selected as the lead astronaut to work with North American Aviation in the recovery from the accident, from the fire. And Frank probably had several problems, but I imagine that there was a tremendous sense of emotional down at Downey [California, the North American facility], where the spacecraft were built. A tremendous sense of guilt, if that’s the right word, or at least responsibility for what had happened. And I think people there first had to go through a kind of a healing or a recovery process in terms of their own recovery from the events of the fire.\\n\\n But once through that, probably measured in a couple of months, people were just that much more high energy when they came back to work on all of the things that had to be done to get the spacecraft ready. Recognizing that the clock was ticking on the ’60s, and recognizing that our competitor, the Soviet Union, was still active and doing things that we didn’t all understand what they were but he was continuing to apparently press the issue of competition of getting to the Moon. And later on, of course, he started to fly the unmanned vehicles; and I guess they had some setbacks in their manned program, certainly with the large rocket that they were trying to build. But a lot of that was kind of unknown to us. So, we just felt this continued pressure from the competition in a sense that they were continuing to press on, and we had better get it right. And we’d better get it on track."

        "utterance": "Yes. I think Wally was carrying a significant sense of wanting to get it done right based on—he had been backup to Gus’s crew at the time of the fire. And I think that was a very powerful influence on all of us. But it was especially powerful, I think, for Wally because of his position as backup crew commander to the first one. And he was very tough about the acceptability of anything in the program. He was very tough about how the spacecraft was handled. He was very tough about the tests that were conducted. I remember—not the details of, but some times when, in the testing at the Cape, he objected to the way things were going in no uncertain terms—as Wally could do very well—and caused the testing to be redone, reshaped, modified, whatever. But he was very tough about that.\\n\\n He also found himself in the position—and he talked to me about this one time—he found himself in a position where individual subsystem people would want something done and would be promoting it. Parachutes for example. Well, parachutes also had an interaction with the reaction control system, in that there was a certain amount of thruster firing and dumping going on the top of that while the parachutes were engaged. But Wally found himself in the position of engaging single—what we would call today in political terms “single interest group.” Just a parachute concern when, indeed, he was trying to deal with a flying concern where he had to meld not only what he had to do—what had to be done with the parachute, but also what had to be done with the thruster system so that the parachute would not be impinged upon in any way by the reaction control system.\\n\\n So, Wally felt like he was dealing with—as we in the flight business also felt—dealing with the total problem, and he was getting approached by these individual single-interest groups that might want to do something that, when viewed in the context of the total problem, might not be such a good idea. So, he found himself getting pressed here and there, and—but he had a way of just backing out of that and not dealing with it at the single-interest level but rather at the total mission level, and therefore, in many cases, won his argument."

I mean, I think both the people on the ground, the engineering teams, the designers, the safety and reliability people, all tried to do the best they could at—before, and during, and afterwards. And I think what we saw, also, was that the crew became more vocal and more willing to jump into a subject and rattle it around in order to be sure that they were satisfied.

So—and I think that got healed on the next flight, for example. And most of them felt like this was too important to let emotional baggage be a problem of any kind.

        "utterance": "Yes. Let’s see. Let me first say that I was not involved in that decision, and it was being done behind closed doors—the decision was being made behind closed doors. And I personally, to this day, don’t know who all had what idea first. However, my sense is that George [M.] Low was a very key player. He was the Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager at the time. He was a very key player in that. And he may have been the person who initiated it. But—and—if he—and if it were not him, I expect that it was [Christopher C.] Kraft [Jr.]. But I’m not sure of that.\\n\\n But when they came out behind closed doors, those two guys and everybody else in the management team were together on it. And I’ve forgotten whether I learned about it immediately before Apollo 7 or immediately afterwards. But when you thought about the stage of the program, we had the lunar module was kind of lagging. It was not quite ready to fly, and it was kind of off a couple of months into the future. We’d had the Saturn V flight, the unmanned—the second unmanned Saturn V called “[AS-]502”, and it didn’t go exactly right, we had some pogo, we had some engine shutdown early and so on. So, it was a problem. We did, however, have a command service module that, after a thorough review, was judged to be capable of going to the Moon.\\n\\n So, we were in the position of kind of, “Well, we can repeat another Earth orbital flight. Or we can do something significantly different than that.” And for most of us in the program, I think when we first heard—and certainly my reaction, and I heard about it from Cliff [Clifford E.] Charlesworth, my dear friend who was the lead flight director for Apollo 8—I heard about it from Cliff, either immediately before or immediately after the flight, I’m not sure which. But, at first it was kind of a shock. Say, “Wow! The second flight we’re going to get on that Saturn V and go to the Moon!” And then the more you thought about it, it seemed like exactly the right step—given all the circumstances that existed in the program.\\n\\n We had a Saturn V that we were going to have to fly. We had a command service module that was ready. There was a lot we didn’t know about going to the Moon and getting back. On the other hand, we probably knew all we were going to do, short of going and doing it. So, we had all those kind of elements in the stew; and out of that came this, what I think was an absolute stroke of genius. And I wish I knew exactly who to attribute it to. But a stroke of genius on the part, I believe, of George Low and, in association with him, Chris in some way, that resulted in that mission being defined and brought forward.\\n\\n The Saturn V. It was interesting to think about it. Sooner or later we were going to put people on top of the Saturn V. And the problem that we had on the previous flight, the unmanned flight, was at least—we didn’t solve the problem. We sort of made it go away by a plan to shut the center engine down early, which got away from the pogo concern. We had five engines on the second stage. The middle one, the center engine, got to vibrating on the previous flight, but very late in the burn time of that stage. So, the idea was, “Well, why don’t we just shut it down a little before we came to the time when that’s a problem?” And time was significant, because all the weights were changing as you used the fuel to propel—."

        "utterance": "Pogo. Glynn has a kind of a layman’s view of pogo, too. But the—what happened is, under certain conditions of engine thrust and the weights that existed in the stage and the flow through the lines—it’s a little bit like the soldiers marching across a bridge in cadence. We learned not to do that, too, because it’s hard on bridges and the people who fall down when they do! And stages could get to vibrating up and down, mostly longitudinally, and really destroy themselves. And in this case, the engine, as it was mounted to this frame in the center, the combination of conditions late in the flight—in terms of flow rates, mostly the weight that was left on the stage—were such that this center engine started to behave in this way where it was beginning to oscillate, called pogo. And it was defensible by simply shutting it down early, not getting into that. And by early I don’t recall the exact numbers, but it was 10 or 20 or 30 seconds, perhaps, earlier than it otherwise would have been shut down. And then the other four engines just continued to burn the propellant, and we got the same amount of energy out of the stage that we otherwise would’ve gotten. We just got to it a little more slowly than we otherwise would.\\n\\n So, at any rate, the point I was going to try to make is, once you decide you’re going to get on a Saturn V—and this fix allowed us to consider that and avoid the problem that pogo brought to the table, rather than solve it, it was avoided—you’re going to take it somewhere. You have to take it at least to Earth orbit. And then if you’re going to burn the last stage, relight it, restart it in orbit, and burn it again—which you should do, because that’s the way the mission sequence has to be to go to the Moon—you can either point it where you want to ultimately go, that is, to the Moon, or you could—you fire it out of plane or crossways or in some way that would not affect the orbit very much, and you’d end up still in Earth orbit. And from a—from the risk that you run when you operate a big rocket system like that, you’re taking all the risk to do that as you would to take it to the Moon. All the risk from a launch vehicle point of view.\\n\\n There’s a new set of risk now for the spacecraft, but those got addressed separately; and the work that had been done in planning for the eventual lunar missions was all brought forward. And it was done well enough so that we could bring that work forward and be confident that we knew all that we could know going into the lunar sequence, the lunar flight sequence, the lunar orbit sequence. And all we had to add to that was whatever we were going to learn when we finally got around to doing it. So, the decision made a lot of sense to me. You’re going to get on the Saturn V and fly it, and you can fly it sort of around and around and not go anywhere or you can fly it to where it’s going or where you want it to go; that is, to the Moon. Either way, while you’re flying around and around in that thing, you’re taking as much risk as you are in terms of taking it to the Moon. So to me, it made a lot of sense. Especially with the state of planning for the lunar trajectories and the state of testing, qualification, and confidence that we had in the Apollo spacecraft that it could go do that."

Well, that’s why I think—I call it “a stroke of genius,” which to me usually means someone comes up with a solution that really fixes a whole bunch of problems that everybody’s worried about but they didn’t know how to put it together and come to the solution. The solution came as the right answer to the conditions that existed within the Apollo Program. Now, I have heard and read various accounts, and maybe speculation, that there was some intelligence information about what the Soviets were doing that might’ve played a part in that decision. I have no knowledge—no personal knowledge of that and I don’t know whether that was true or not. Nobody ever explained it to me, which was fine. I didn’t necessarily feel like I needed to know that kind of stuff.\\n\\n But just on its merits, within the program, it was almost immediately embraced by people after, you know, an initial reaction. Embraced in the sense that, “Boy, that seems like the right answer! Why didn’t I think of that? It just fits everything that we have, solves it, and takes us a great big step forward! Rather than just tooling around and around in some other kind of a mission, it goes out and addresses a whole bunch of problems that we’re going to have to learn how to solve and deal with before we ever do get to land.” So, that was a—I think it was a breakthrough, genius class of decision."

        "utterance": "Yes. I—as a matter of fact, I was on for that shift. We had all this strange nomenclature called “lunar orbit insertion [LOI],” and I was on for the lunar orbit insertion team where we had to use the service propulsion engine. And let me back up a little bit and tell you a story about getting to there during the course of the flight.\\n\\n Early on in the flight, because we were going to use—because we were going to be so dependent on the service propulsion system to take us into orbit and take us especially back out of orbit at the Moon, we had planned a test firing—a small burn, of the service propulsion system—soon after we got on our way to the Moon. And I don’t recall the exact details of it; but, as I remember, it had to be done kind of early and there wasn’t too much opportunity to do it later. We would’ve perturbed the trajectory; that is, the trajectory that had us aimed for going into the orbit that we wanted around the Moon. And so, we had this test planned. And it was several seconds long, what we were going to, in effect, almost burp the service propulsion system, the main engine that we were going to use at the Moon. And we were doing that as a confidence thing, that we were going to be sure that it had—that the engine was behaving and it was going to be okay. Well, as luck would have it, the test did not go as expected.\\n\\n There had been a significant amount of helium absorbed, or something, into the propellant. And at any rate, the chamber pressure measurements did not look normal. And I was on duty at that time. This was back right after we had put the vehicle on the coast out to the Moon and we’d performed this test. So, we were stuck with this quandary of, “Gee, we put this test in here to be sure the service propulsion system’s working right and, lo and behold, it’s really not working exactly right.” And it wasn’t anything obvious that we, as flight controllers or as—users and operators of the system could see that would tell us that.\\n\\n But there was a man from North American Aviation named Harry Galinas, who was the subsystem manager for the service propulsion system. He came in and sat down here at this console and explained to me that, in the loading process at the Cape, which he was present for, there was some set of conditions that he observed that would explain the reasons why the chamber pressure didn’t come up all the way to what we expected it to be. And in his mind, he was completely satisfied that that was explainable and that it was now, in effect, going out of the system. It had passed through—the gas had passed through the system—and the system was going to work fine.\\n\\n And about the time I was dealing with this, at the console, was when we got a tape recording sent down to the Control Center and—with instructions from the crew, or suggestions from the crew, to go look at it and listen to it. Well, that was when somebody had gotten sick onboard. Well, what was interesting for me is that everybody else, all the management, [Dr. Charles A.] Chuck Berry and—on the surgeon side, all of our management went off to work on this problem of somebody being sick up onboard. And I was sitting there with this service propulsion system that, if we were going to do something about, we had to do it fast. That is, if we wanted to do another test, we had to do it real quickly. And I ended up being convinced by Harry Galinas that the service propulsion system was really okay. The gas had passed through and it was fine. It was just as good as it always was to do the mission to the Moon. So, I was there and decided that the story held together. We had a number of other opinions thrown into it to validate it. But Harry was the key player, and convinced me that the engine was going to be okay.\\n\\n So then, several days later, I was on duty for the lunar orbit insertion. And we’d been through all kind of planning for, “What do we do if we get no burn, partial burn, this kind of burn, that kind of burn, this kind of condition?” and so on. And we’d been through a lot of simulations with the crew in terms of testing all that. We’d been through a lot of mission rules about how much redundancy we wanted in the spacecraft—basically, all of it—to go into the lunar orbit because we, of course, had to come back out. And that—for me, the background for the lunar orbit was that this problem that we had worked and dispositioned as being okay, back here three days before, right after we left Earth orbit. And we came to the Moon convinced that the service propulsion system was going to do fine.\\n\\n And what we used to do in the room was calculate the time. In other words, if no—the time of reappearance on the other side of the Moon. So, if it went in on the left side, we had a variety of calculations set. If there’s no burn at all, it’s going to come out fast and it’ll be at this time. And if we have a successful burn, it’s going to come out at this time. And somewhere in between would be less than successful. But we knew exactly what the times were for each condition; that is, no burn at all or a completely successful burn.\\n\\n And for us, it felt a little bit like a countdown to the time. Because clearly, there was no signal from the spacecraft for—for no—at the time that would go with no burn at all. So, it became increasingly apparent that we had indeed made the burn; and then as we got closer to the time that would go with the nominal burn, it felt more and more confident. I felt a little more confident that, indeed, the burn had gone well and was on track. And then, indeed, the crew came around the corner telling us about that. And we could tell from the time we picked up the signal that the burn had gone very well. But they came back and gave us a report about how well it had gone, and so on and so on. And a big sense of relief. But not—[Recording interrupted.]"

We’ve really got here.” But overshadowing it all was the sense that in, whatever it was, 20 hours or so, we were going to have to do it again and get on our way home. So, it isn’t like just getting to lunar orbit, you know, was home free. It wasn’t like that. It was like we had this big shadow hanging over our head about, “The engines have got to work again. We’ve got to come on back,” and so on and so on. But nevertheless, being in lunar orbit first time: a tremendous sense of accomplishment for this team.\\n\\n A tremendous sense of being there. And the whole period, 20 something—I think it was 10 orbits, wasn’t it? 20 hours or so that we were in lunar orbit—went by very quickly. But Christmas Eve the crew came around the corner, did their reading from Genesis [in the Bible]. I mean, it just seemed to me that it was a perfect choice of commentary, if that’s the right word. But a perfect choice of material to use in the kind of an environment we were in, Christmas Eve. I mean, it was just—I don’t know how those guys thought of it. But I have to admire that as another stroke of genius. And it had a powerful effect in the Control Center here. I mean, people felt genuinely moved by the reading; genuinely moved by it. And a sense of, as that would conjure up a sense of thanksgiving of sorts for the fact that we had been looked after. We had been looked after. And that things were going well, and they gave every indication that they were going to continue to go well, etc. But a great deal of comfort in how that lunar orbit period played out.\\n\\n And then the crew’s comments about the Moon, and their comments about the Earth. And the Earthrise coming from behind the Moon. All of those were just—it’s kind of an emotional things that were almost like we had been planning for it, not exactly in this form, but we’d been planning for it in our minds. But perhaps more importantly, in our guts, in our heart, for 10 years. Not quite but almost. The best part of that decade. And have everybody involved knew what kind of blood, sweat, and tears had gone into getting there. And it was like, it came out just perfect. I mean, it was like we had reached it. And, of course then, the rest of the Apollo 8 flight went by the book. The propulsion system was used again 20 hours later for the transearth injection [TEI]. A couple of midcourses [correction burns] on the way back, and a close to target point landing. And the sense that I had was that it was the turning point in Apollo.\\n\\n It was—once we had done that, yes, we needed to get the lunar module. Yes, we needed to get it. Yes, we needed to get the descent done. And so on, and so on. But it was like we were going downhill. In other words, we had—we had gotten over this thing about getting to the Moon, and now we were going back with another piece of space hardware, called the lunar module. And we were going to be able to do—we were eventually going to be able to do the landing. It turned out to be on Apollo 11, after another rehearsal on Apollo 10.\\n\\n But Apollo 8 was kind of, one—just a stroke of genius to—for the decision to run that kind of mission. And then it just felt—to a lot of the people in the program, certainly to me, it felt like it was the breakthrough or the gate opener or the part where we started to slide downhill to what we could foresee as the potential for the lunar landing mission to occur well within the decade that we had been struggling hard—so hard for, for so many years."

But there’s a sense of stomach awareness and perhaps even going beyond that, that people experience when they’re just released from any of the gravity. They get sensitive to how quickly they turn their head, and so on; and they—and that can induce a sickness. And so, the closest thing we have to it that we can talk about and experience is motion sickness. You know, when you’re on a boat or something.\\n\\n But it’s real for crews. And the problem that we had had was, we hadn’t experienced. I didn’t know that we’d experience any. We may’ve experienced some in Gemini, but I didn’t know that we had. And if we had, the crews didn’t say anything about it. And—but the Mercury spacecraft and the Gemini spacecraft were physically very, very constrained. The crews were, in effect, strapped into a couch the whole time they flew, and there was not a sense of floating around. I mean, the seats and the cockpits were such that there just wasn’t a sense of that.\\n\\n Then we got them into this Apollo volume, which was fairly large, where they could, indeed, float around and so on and so on. And I think it was that, that all of a sudden made us more sensitive to it. And I don’t know the exact numbers, but I suspect that some fairly significant percentage of people continue to be affected by it today. I mean, the docs have struggled with countermeasures and so on and so on. And they’ve probably done some good with it, but I think people still experience it. It’s just such a different kind of environment for the body."

We chose to keep them in Earth orbit, because it was the first time out with the lunar module. We had to get an exercise of all the systems onboard the lunar module. We wanted to be able to test the rendezvous techniques and separation, and so on and so on. And all of those got a good ring out, including the fact that it was the first time that we had people onboard the lunar module. So in effect, it was the Apollo 7—it was like an Apollo 7 for the lunar module. But it passed with flying colors.\\n\\n And, yes, I would say that it probably didn’t get a lot of attention. And it might’ve been because of Apollo 8, you know, on Christmas Eve; and then looking forward to Apollo 10 and Apollo 11, or whatever the landing sequence was going to be. So, something that we were doing in low-Earth orbit to test the command service module in conjunction with the lunar module probably didn’t get the kind of attention, it didn’t have quite the same pizzazz as Apollo 8 or the landing mission was eventually going to have. So, I think it was a natural sort of set of conditions that we had.

And then add the next step for the Apollo 11 mission.” And that was the logic for how we got to where we got on Apollo 10.\\n\\n I had a good time with it—with the flight, because I had worked, and worked well, with Gene and Tom, as I said, on Gemini IX. And we went through all the training exercises and all the what-ifs, and all the getting readys, and all the struggles with the simulations, and so on and so on. And we were comfortable. And Apollo 10 did its job. We had some exciting moments here and there, especially in lunar orbit when the vehicle kind of spun up because of a configuration problem onboard the lunar module, but that got handled fairly quickly and was settled. And it was—it basically paved the way for, then, the Apollo 11 crew to add to the inventory of what they had to know and what they had to train for. To add the descent part of it, and the surface work part of it. And I think it made Apollo 11 a little more assured and a little bit more solid for the crews to train for, and so on."

And I can’t remember the exact details of it, but I think what happened is: they either switched into—they probably—I think they switched into a mode that had been set up to do something that they were not expecting. It was set up to go someplace else in terms of the attitude of the vehicle. This was not affecting the trajectory of the vehicle in any way. It was affecting the attitude of the vehicle as it coasted around in lunar orbit. And they switched into this system that they thought was going to do this, and it turned out doing that. And it surprised them quite a bit. But they rather quickly got the vehicle back under control. You know, a good reaction on the part of the crew. Certainly not the—the spinning of the vehicle was not something that you wanted to propagate very long, or that in itself can induce some physical problems for people—including blacking out. But, they caught it pretty quickly and got it back under control; and we were fine."

        "utterance": "You know, when we first got started with this—the television onboard the spacecraft—there were mixed views within the Control Center here, and the people in the Control Center within the program, as to whether that would be a good thing. A lot of us started off viewing it as basically a PAO [Public Affairs Office] or a public relations kind of a thing. And to some extent, it always was that as we went through the program. But it also created a kind of a sense of us being with the crew, being in the cockpit, and we learned that we could watch something on television and not get unduly wondering about what was going on, and asking them a bunch of dumb questions that had to do with what was going on because we couldn’t tell.\\n\\n And it turned out to be a—I think, a tremendous add to the program all the way through to today. And I think, being able to visualize with TV what’s happening upstairs and what the crews are experiencing and how they’re dealing with it, just makes it a lot easier for the people here in the Control Center to interact with them. That’s especially true on things like EVAs. Because it’s difficult to put in words all of the things that are going on, all of the places that you are, what you’re holding on to, how big it is, and so on and so on. And yet by observing that with the TV camera, you eliminate a whole bunch of sort of somewhat irrelevant, maybe dumb questions that you might—or conversations that you might otherwise be provoked to have with the crew. Because, of course, when you just have the radio, and whenever something’s not being said, you just have to imagine what’s going on and so on. But with the television added to the audio, you can see it. And so our sense of anxiety, if that’s the right term, for how things are going is diminished because we can see how things are going, and we’re not unduly alarmed.\\n\\n As a matter of fact, I would say the same thing about the recovery television. For a while, we didn’t have recovery television. We sat in this Control Center and it seemed like hours, you know, and we’d get this occasional radio report on what was going on [during the recovery phase]. But it just seemed like such a long time to not know how things were! Then once we started putting a television in the carriers and in the helos in the recovery area, we could see what was going on and there was no need for us to be anxious or to be asking anybody any dumb questions. We could just monitor what was going on and relax—in effect, relax about it, because we could see. And it was easy to judge progress. It was easy to judge, “Well, they’re here now. So it’s going to take so and so long.” So, the sense of, “I don’t know what’s going on so I’m going to get anxious about it” kind of got taken off the page with the TV, both in the cockpit and TV on the lunar surface, of course, and TV in the recovery area. It was a big help."

It actually was of help to us in the Control Center. And to provide that and to support that. Because sometimes the initial arguments about getting a television onboard the spacecraft were somewhat heated. Some people didn’t want to do it at all. And once we started using it, it was hard to imagine getting along without it. Right? It was hard to imagine that. “Why could—why have we waited to so long? Why have we waited so long to get these cameras onboard? We can see what’s going on!”\\n\\n And today the—the folks use it—use them in a very interactive way in terms of diagnostics, troubleshooting, etc. It’s even gotten to the point where they have a digital still camera that they can show very high accurate—high-definition pictures of. And all of that stuff is a tremendous assistance. As a matter of fact, today, when you envision the Space Station, and something that large with crews doing things with it—EVA or otherwise—the television is just going to make it so much easier for the ground controllers to know what the crews are doing and to appreciate it. And for them to contribute to whatever the crews are trying to do at a given point."

        "utterance": "Well, let’s see. The sequence we were on, Cliff Charlesworth was the prime flight director for Apollo 11. And we brought a number of us over from the other missions that had been doing different things. I worked on Apollo 11 for both lunar orbit, which I had done on Apollo 8—lunar orbit insertion—and then I worked on—the other significant shift I had was for the takeoff from the Moon and the rendezvous because I had done Apollo 10, where we had done something pretty close to that. So the past couple of flights that I had participated in made those natural assignments for me. Cliff was the lead and kind of orchestrated the whole thing. Gene [Eugene F.] Kranz spent a lot of time getting ready for the descent phase, because he had kind of focused on the lunar module per se as a vehicle and was much involved with the procedures and the planning for what the descent was going to be like. So, it kind of all fell out naturally and easily for us as to what we were going to focus on for the particular flight.\\n\\n But you know, today, and I must admit, I feel inadequate in terms of trying to capture for people the sense and the emotion and the feelings that we had at the time. I guess we engineers are never very good at expressing this feelings thing. But it had been such a long struggle, and with high cost—dollar cost, yes, but with other cost, including accidents, and other cost to the program, none of which was a deterrent in any way to us—but nevertheless it had—we’d paid a price over the years. But we had also had a tremendous number of achievements on all the precursor flights, precursor programs and the flights within them.\\n\\n So, we were building towards this thing, sort of, all of our young life. I mean, what was I, 32 or something at the time we landed on the Moon? And we had been working on that for a long time. And it was part of our being, you know. We were going to do this thing. And we’d been through all the early difficulties. The problem that we had, also, was that things happened so quickly. We have been talking about Apollo 7 in October [1968]. Apollo 8 in December. Apollo 9, which I didn’t work on [1969]. Apollo 10, May/June [1969]. Apollo 11 in July. I mean, it was like we just got through one major set of accomplishments and before we had time to savor and enjoy the accomplishment that the mission we were on represented, we were off working on the next one. So—but Apollo 11 was such a special one because it was the convergence, the endpoint, the goal, the “end game,” as people—the term they use today, for what we had been involved in for so long.\\n\\n And the buildup to the flight was good. Late in the series, in terms of getting ready for it, the team had found out about these alarms that—they had occurred either in a simulator or a test somewhere. So, people had begun to delve into this business of these alarms and what they might portend in terms of the performance of the guidance system. The alarms came from the guidance system, the guidance computer, and were an indication of kind of overload. It’s like, \"I’m getting too much work to do here, people!\" And they were not very black and white in terms of, you know, a signature that—where you could absolutely conclude that this signature means “It’s bad and I got to stop” or the signature is “Acceptable, and we can continue it.” It was kind of murky because there were a number of circumstances that could produce them. And the frequency of them had something to do with how serious they were, too. So, in the end, the guys that worked on this problem—the lunar descent team—and all the other people around the flight software recognized that they would—they might be faced with some judgment calls as to what these alarms might be telling them. If they even occurred during the course of the flight. And, of course, they did. But I get ahead of my story.\\n\\n Each step of Apollo 11, you know getting to the countdown, getting the crew in, getting to ignition, getting to Earth orbit, each one of those was like a major step on the ladder; and each one was, you know, today it feels like it was sort of inexorable. I mean, it just ground on, on its preplanned path. But at the time, there was a great deal of uncertainty and concern and anxiety about how each one of these things was going to turn out. So, we were in a constant mode of looking at everything that was displayed in this Control Center and trying to be sure that, indeed, things were going as well as all this data—telemetry data and tracking data—was telling us that it was. And sort of pins and needles, I would say.\\n\\n The coast out to the Moon was fairly quiet, as they usually are. A sense of the crew sort of gathering themselves for the challenge that they had when they get to the Moon. And in general, the communications from the Control Center sort of slacked off quite a bit in those—in the coast out to the Moon. Kind of, I don’t think we ever talked about it exactly, but it was kind of in deference to what had to be a \"gathering oneself\" kind of a thing that was going on with the crews onboard the vehicle. With the challenge to be faced at the Moon. So, that was fairly quiet. And then some of the things that we’d already done. The lunar orbit insertion. Done that before. It went just by the book. And then we got into the descent module—again, to the lunar module for the descent phase.\\n\\n By that time, all three shifts plus more of everybody that had been on this thing were here plugged into the Control Center. There’s usually four jacks at each console, and we were all plugged in following it. And the descent phase to the Moon is one of major propulsion activity, so therefore it has all the risks that go with the propulsion activity. We had some abort modes, which basically amounted to if the descent engine went bad, just getting off that stage and going with the ascent engine back up. In effect, doing the rendezvous very early. But the going down to the Moon is a race against the clock because the lunar module was designed with a certain size, therefore a certain amount of propellants, and they’re being used up at a seemingly great rate as we go down towards the Moon. And the idea is to get to a landing point before you—before you run those tanks dry.\\n\\n Neil [A. Armstrong], of course, had to do some looking around to find a place that he was satisfied with, and frankly, I was a little bit surprised by that. Because my impression from all the discussion of where we were landing was that, “Pusht!” you know, there was nothing there and it was going to be a piece of cake. It was just a flat, sandy field. It turned out it really wasn’t quite that way for him, and he had to do some searching around. The whole time, in everybody’s mind, you know, there’s this \"tick-tock\" going on about the propellants going down. And Neil picked the spot, took it in.\\n\\n I would say, I mean, this—I would make this comment about most of the astronauts. I mean, people would have confidence that almost all of them could do that mission. We viewed them as somewhat interchangeable. They had different personalities, and some were more or less fun to work with. But they’re more or less interchangeable. I wouldn’t say that across the board. But we felt that most of them were more or less interchangeable. And Neil, of course, had flown this crazy thing we had out here at Ellington [Field], this lunar landing test vehicle [Lunar Landing Training Vehicle (LLTV)], and actually had to eject out of it at one point. So, people had a lot of confidence in Neil throughout the program. But they always had a lot of confidence in him. And in the Control Center, there was a sense of, “He’s looking for the spot. He knows where he is on the fuel,” so we just “Shut up and leave him alone.” And, indeed, that’s exactly the case. And then he landed with, I don’t know how many seconds, but not very many seconds of fuel left. You probably know the number, Roy."

And Charlie [Charles M.] Duke [Jr.], the Capcom [capsule communicator] at the time, probably expressed our view here in the Control Center very well in that we—he really did have a bunch of guys about to turn blue. But, there we were. And then the images from the Moon, you know, with them walking, going down the ladder, and then going out on the lunar surface, kind of grainy, black-and-whitey, almost otherworldly. And I guess it was otherworldly! Eerie feeling to me. Just an eerie feeling to watch this go on and to still have in my head the background that we still had a long way to get home for all this. But, nevertheless, a sense of, “Boy, oh boy!” you know, “We’ve thought about this, planned for it, and so many thousands of people have worked so hard for it for so many years. And here it is. It’s happening right in front of us in this Control Center. And we can see it from the Moon.” So, it was kind of riveting the whole time. But also kind of eerie for me to watch it.\\n\\n It just seemed different than I expected, whatever that was. But I think everybody here was—and associated with the program—was very moved by the whole sequence. And then, of course, back in the ship. And the rest of the mission went fine back here. And then they had to spend so many—how many days or weeks were they in those funny uniforms [Biological Isolation Garments (BIGS)], locked up in a cave [Lunar Receiving Laboratory, Manned Spacecraft Center, Houston, Texas] while we were sure that nothing bad came back with them? A reasonable precaution. I make light of it, but it was a reasonable precaution to take at the time.\\n\\n But seeing their faces. And the interesting thing for me was that so many people had worked together for so long. A lot of people don’t get much visibility. The planners for the mission—all the mission planning people, the flight control team, the flight crews. But then all the people who built the vehicles. The launch vehicle people, spacecraft people, and the people at the Cape who got these things ready for launch. They did a similar piece of work to what we did here in Houston. They did a lot of it preflight. We did a lot of it after liftoff. All those people. All of them. You know, a million cogs in this machine worked so hard and then it worked. A tremendous sense of accomplishment, I think, for everybody. A tremendous sense of achievement.\\n\\n I remember after the flight, sometime somebody came around and they were interviewing people—those of us involved in the program—for what we thought was most significant about it. And a variety of people had given, you know, what were reasonably standard answers at the time. You know, the competition with the Russians, technology, political, and so on and so on. For me, though—and maybe this is back to my eerie and otherworldly feelings when I was watching it—it was the first time two people from this planet had lived and worked on another, not planet but, heavenly body. Left this place! Left this place! And went to one of those. And, you know, it makes me think of how, as a race, you know, people sat around little fires or poked their head out of caves and looked at the stars and wondered what they were. And here we were, being part of something that—two people from this human race left it, left the planet. Spent a couple of days in another place, living and working, and came back to tell us about it. A tremendous feeling."

        "utterance": "Well, no. You know, at the time—I’ve said this in other places—at the time, you know, I was young enough where my sense was, “This is going to go on forever.” I mean, we were having so much fun. It was wonderful stuff. It was just going to go on forever. And Apollo 12 was, by the way, just a natural part of my thinking at the time was, “It’s just going to go on and on.” I hadn’t thought about how it was going to end and what we were going to do after that, and so on. And Apollo 12 had some specific plans for the mission. But let me digress for just a moment. Because what—I think a significant thing was happening in the program just as we made that transition.\\n\\n The people who represented the lunar sciences had a set of priorities and things that wanted to be accomplished, and they were less than pleased with what we did on Apollo 11. Their view was that we should be doing a whole bunch of scientific things on Apollo 11, and the view in the program was, “Hey, look, you know, we need to land and, yeah, do what we can. But we need to land and then get out of there, and make it successful. And then, later, we will undertake all these other things that want to be done.” And I would say that at the time of 11, it was probably true that there was a science camp and then an operations camp, and they were indeed separate camps. For the most part.\\n\\n But then as the rest of the Apollo sequence began to lay out, we began to realize—we, in the operations business, began to realize that we were really going to try to get as much science as we possibly could from however many missions we had yet to go. And there was a moving together, a coalescence of the two camps, so that by the time we got to, oh I don’t know exactly what—maybe Apollo 14 or certainly by 15 there was a complete convergence of the two camps into one team. And we were all comfortable with each other, and had had a number of experiences together that made us, as operators, sensitive to what the life science folks wanted to accomplish. And had a general idea of why they were trying to do what they were trying to do. So, we became much more sympathetic and empathetic to what their objectives were.\\n\\n And I say that because there was a strong press by the science community that we need to get on with doing some science on the Moon. And one of the keys to that was going to be, we needed to be able to land somewhere that was reasonably predictable. By that I mean, we needed to be able to land with a set of—with an accuracy so that traverses could be planned that would accomplish most of what the scientists wanted. But it didn’t mean you could just randomly land anywhere on the lunar surface and expect to get the same kind of scientific return as you would if we landed exactly where we had planned to land because they could do a lot of research on a particular location. And so on and so on.\\n\\n So, Apollo 12—to me the major challenge that it had was demonstrating that we could land in a specific place. And we picked a—so as not to confuse one set of gray rocks with another set of gray rocks—we picked a Surveyor site, where there was a Surveyor that had landed there earlier on in the ’60s, as part of the unmanned lunar exploration program. And there it was, sitting there. So, again, I got off Apollo 11 and here are all these guys talking about a pinpoint landing by a Surveyor on the Moon. And you know, my brain was having the same problem comprehending that that I did when we first heard about Apollo 8, and so on. I said, “My God! How can we possibly do that?”\\n\\n But it turns out that this planning group that I talked about here in Houston, run by Bill [Howard W.] Tindall [Jr.] and some others, but Bill was, I think, the genius behind that activity, although there were other players in it, too. But, Bill had—Bill’s team had developed a set of techniques for measuring what was happening to the orbits as we ran around the Moon well enough so that we could update the guidance as we went on down, in the descent phase, so that the lunar module knew where it was all the time and knew where it was relative to where we were trying to go—that is, the landing site. And, this problem was compounded because we found out that the Moon has these mass concentrations [mascons] close to the surface, probably from big things hitting it and being buried in the Moon. But they could perturb the orbit. So, we had to develop techniques for sensing these perturbations, and then factoring them back in. Because those perturbations could be large compared to the missed distance that would be generated from a particular landing site, or a targeted landing site that we were trying to make.\\n\\n So, had to figure out how to do all that stuff. And these planning guys figured that out! I mean, it’s just—it’s amazing! Analyst sheets are in other people. Quiet, studious, analytical kind of guys can come up with these things you could do and, you know, little corrections you could put into the guidance system that would allow us to land at a particular target. Which is, of course, what ultimately we did on Apollo 12, right at the Surveyor site. But I got there awful fast for you, because I stepped over a couple of big parts of Apollo 12. The major one in my mind being the liftoff from the Cape.\\n\\n VOICE OFF CAMERA: Tape change…. [Recorder turned off.]"

        "utterance": "Gerry [Gerald D.] Griffin was the lead flight director for Apollo 12, and he was on duty for the liftoff from the Cape; and the weather was kind of ratty. Clouds and probably a little rain. And, frankly, we—another one of these things we didn’t get ready for as much as we should have, perhaps—definitely as much as we should’ve—was the risk of lightning. Or lightning discharge. So, lo and behold, you know, everybody thought it was okay at the Cape to launch this thing; and we’re sitting back here waiting to receive it when it got handed over to Mission Control; and off it went, you know. A typical hurrah when we got a liftoff. But shortly thereafter, this huge lightning bolt—I mean, a lightning bolt but discharge, came out of the back end of the ship down to the ground and set all the instruments just crazy inside—inside the command module, you know. Fuel cells popping off the buses and on and on and on.\\n\\n There’s a attitude indicator that we call an eight ball—it’s kind of round with a black part for the horizon and white part for above the horizon, and the crews use that for attitude reference and to know where they are, kind of, flying; and we call it an eight ball for short. This little eight ball was apparently just spinning around wildly in this cockpit from the effects of the strike. Fortunately, the effects were essentially all confined to some of the systems in the spacecraft—that is, the command module—and it didn’t seem to affect the lunar module at all, which was relatively unpowered at the time. And it didn’t affect the launch vehicle at all.\\n\\n So, here we were going uphill, on the Saturn V, this big bolt having decided to release itself and come down out of the back end of it. And it was still working okay—and, you know, the launch vehicle was still working okay and everything was hanging on. But the spacecraft instrumentation and the reports from the crew indicated it was just Christmas trees, you know, inside the cockpit in terms of warning lights and so on, going on, and it was hold your breath time. I mean, the launch phase on a Saturn or any other rocket is a hold-your-breath time. But this was really accentuated because we just didn’t know what it is we had experienced and how it was going to manifest itself, if at all. But fortunately, the launch vehicle just tooled right on up and we got into orbit fine.\\n\\n And then we’re sitting over here with Gerry on the console, and we’re looking at everything on the telemetry; and by that time we had got the spacecraft reset, powered better, kind of made all the connections, got the attitude indicator and the platform behind it that drove it, got it aligned and got it behaving right. So, we’re spending a couple of orbits going around in Earth orbit, looking at the data, saying, “Gee, everything seems to be working well. But we had this terrible thing happen back there, and we don’t know.” For example, the parachute system and some of the separation systems have these little devices called pyrotechnics, which are like fireworks, and any one of them could have gone off for all we knew. And they’re not—it would not be apparent in—for example the parachute pyros could’ve gone off and the parachutes could have been sitting up there on the deck deployed or severed, you know, released! We didn’t know any of that, and there was no way to know.\\n\\n So, out of all the things we could look at on the launch vehicle and the spacecraft, they were all nominal. There were things that we couldn’t see. But there were things that had to work when we reentered, so we said, “Well, we can reenter and see if they work, or we can go on and do our mission and then reenter 10 days later and see if they work.” And, it was kind of a peculiar thing, because we got to looking at it and saying, “Well, everything seems to be working fine.” And we were prepared to find some things that maybe weren’t working fine because of the jolt. But eventually we decided, “Well, looks okay. So, let’s go do it.” And off we went for the burn, the S-IVB burn, that would put us on the coast out to the Moon.\\n\\n And off we went. Let’s see.—and then as I said, the mission was kind of designed around this idea of a landing at a pinpoint location, landing at the Surveyor, and all of the things—as I recall, going out to the Moon and getting ready to go down were pretty nominal, as I recall. And we’d solved the alarm problem in the lunar module computer by that time. I can’t remember. Is that the problem with—is that the flight we had an abort light problem on Apollo 12?"

And it was a set of techniques that had been developed to help these planners, that would, you know, convert it into things that we could actually do with ourselves and with the ground crew—with the air crews and—and get the vehicle knowing where it was and where it wanted to go, and get there properly.

Distressed may be too strong a term. But I sort of felt it was natural; because, indeed, there we had it. We had two lunar landing missions. They went pretty well. People seemed to—there was sort of a sense that people felt that we could do this, and it was going to be okay, and we kind of had the risks managed, and we knew what we were doing. So, there was every expectation that we could do it again, several more times, and that it would be okay.\\n\\n But Apollo 13 turned out to be—not delay—not that case. And, you know, various people have said various things about it. But, you know, to me it was a very, very special mission and, in terms of its effect on people—and I hearken back to the comment I made a little while ago about two members of the human racing exploring this distant planet, or at least a distant celestial body—here were three members of the human race, you know, at risk of being stranded or worse, killed, on Apollo 13. And it seemed to have a tremendous galvanizing effect on people all around the world.\\n\\n I mean, I just remember seeing clips of the people watching the little tickertape things that go around buildings. The little lights things [scrolling message boards]. And there were people watching that all over the world, in Europe, in Africa, in the Far East. And, you know, again a sense of, the whole human race was concerned about the safety and return of these—just these couple of representatives of the human race. Three of them. A tremendous sense, to me, of involvement in the urgency and the risk of the mission that people were picking up on. So, I think, in a sense, it’s still—it was—that to me sure showed that people still had a tremendous feeling for this activity in their hearts and in their guts. But in terms of the day-to-day coverage of it, it had been—gotten, you know, two successes in a row, which is a string, of sorts. And there was just less interest with all the other things that were going on in the country at the time that were competing for the same resources, media resources, for attention and so on. So to me, it was kind of natural. But I was frankly somewhat overwhelmed at the response of people around the world during the course of the Apollo 13 mission. I mean, it was really gratifying."

But what came to my mind was how, after these many years since, as a matter of fact, the Redstone launch that kicked it off, Alan [B.] Shepard [Jr.] was on a crew going back to the Moon. And in the case of both Deke [Donald K.] Slayton and Alan, who both had different kinds of problems but nevertheless it affected their flight status and their ability to get a seat, you know, other people would—might have left the program. But both Deke and Al remained in the program, played very significant roles in terms of the—representing the flight crews, the flight—getting the flight crews ready, the flight crew involvement with the management processes, and so on and so on.\\n\\n And, you know, looking back on it, you have to really admire the way they recovered, if that’s the right word, from what had to have been a very strong emotional blow to guys of that type. You know, fighter pilots who get bumped for medical reasons. And you had to give him credit for sticking with the program, and then for not only just being here, but for making the contribution that they did the whole time. Both of them. And so—[loudspeaker interruption]\n\nSo, you know, my view was that after the contributions that I would say represent almost, by both what Deke and Al did, I was really very pleased to see that Alan got an opportunity to get back on flight status and to get that flight. I’m sure that there was a set of crew assignment things that affected a lot of people in the crew office. But as I said before, to me a lot of these folks were interchangeable in terms of their talent and their abilities, but because of the one—this kick start that Alan gave the program with his—with him being himself on the first Redstone, the first Mercury flight. It just seemed to me fitting that he did have an opportunity to go back and land and walk on the Moon. And then, of course, he added his own style to that by fashioning a golf club out of one of his tools and whacking a few golf balls around the Moon—with claims of extraordinary distance, I’m sure. But, anyway, for me, it was kind of pleasant and seemed appropriate somehow that Al had the chance to get back and fly."

And, as a matter of fact, Apollo 15 was the first of what was called the “J” series, which was an arbitrary designator for a set of enhanced capabilities that we put—built into the spacecraft—both of them—that would enable and enhance the amount of science return that we could get while we were at the Moon. On the lunar module, we were able to stay longer. We were able to support more EVAs, traverses. We had the lunar rover [Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV)] that allowed the crews considerably more range in getting around the Moon. We had advanced science exploration packages that we were able to deploy and leave on the Moon. And, in general, the missions starting with Apollo 15 were all the result or the consummation of the concern for the lunar research, the lunar science, that got—manifested itself in a set of quite a bit of new hardware, and quite a bit of new capability that we had, with the lunar module, starting with 15, and with the command service module.\\n\\n We had built a thing called a SIM bay, which stood for scientific instrument modules. A whole set of different kind of sensors that were like Earth resources sensors that were built into the—one of the bays of the—of the service module. And then those were used all during the lunar orbit stay, while the command module pilot was up there and the other guys were down, to conduct another set of measurements of the Moon from 60 miles or so. So, in both vehicles, there was a substantial enhancement to what could be done. All of it targeted at pinpoint landings, now that we had those under our belt, and then traverses that could now be planned with the range that went with the lunar rover, and with the number of EVAs that could be conducted. We were up to three, I think, at the time of Dave’s flight.\\n\\n So, getting ready for that flight was again the continuation of this blending of the operations people—the air crews and the ground crews—with the scientific community. The crews had been joined with the scientific community probably longer than the folks here in the Control Center. But by the time we got to—well, really Apollo 12, Gerry Griffin spent some time with the lunar surface planners, and that continued on 14 and accelerated even when we got to 15 because of the significant more capability that we had. And I got to go on a couple of those geology field trips with the crews. And it was—I mean, I don’t know that I learned a lot of geology, but I learned to be empathetic to what people were trying to accomplish. And off we went with Apollo 15, with a significant amount of new capability and a significant amount of equipment that would allow the scientific return to be considerably enhanced."

And, for example, President [John F.] Kennedy somehow was able to see this competition in the—and, by the way, the fear that that generated and the concern that that generated in the American people. And out of this sense of worriedness that was going on about where we stood with respect to the Soviet Union, especially in this new frontier, he was able, with the help of other people I suppose, to generate this goal that was an answer to this fear. And so on. So, that’s what I meant by right. It wasn’t arbitrary. But it really resonated. It was the right kind of decision with people. And then when that kind of choice is made by a political leader, that’s the—that’s right and feels so right to people, and then the support is provided, it just is amazing to me what we were able to achieve!\\n\\n I would not say to you that we were, you know, geniuses of any kind. We were just regular folks who happened to come along when this thing occurred, and happened to join it. We were not selected like the astronauts were, for example, with a national screening of all the pilots in the country, you know, and a very rigorous sort of a process. This was sort of like, people showed up because they wanted to do this work. And we were, you know, quick and medium and some maybe even a little bit less than medium. But the combined talents of that group kind of energized by the motivation that they all had, and the dedication they had, made it work.\\n\\n It impressed me that human activity and human endeavors are probably generally underestimated in terms of what can be done when the circumstances—when it’s the right kind of a program, the circumstances are right, the support is there, and then you let people do the job. The situation doesn’t repeat itself a lot, probably, especially in one single endeavor; but probably opportunities like that pop up all the time, but they pop up in different fields. So, they’re not seen as the same sort of thing, perhaps, when indeed they are. But, I was impressed at what this country was able to do. And it was not a given that we could. I mean, there were just a tremendous number of, certainly, technical unknowns going into this and probably a lot of other unknowns, too. But certainly a lot of technical ones that I could relate to. But, you know, it’s amazing what we were able to do.\\n\\n Amazing what we were able to do in this Control Center with a lot of very young people. When we were doing the Apollos, most of us were in our 20s. Late 20s, perhaps, but some middle 20s. A large number of very young people had an opportunity then to do something that was much larger than ourselves. And it worked! It somehow called out the best in people; and somehow people showed up at the right time, when they were needed. And it just all kind of gelled. And it’s amazing what can be done when the circumstances are right, the leadership is right, and the support is there. Oh yeah. Lots of things can happen. Lots of good things can happen."

And threatened occasionally, and so on. So, it was a very high kind of tension in those fields. And it played into everybody, I think, in America. Everybody felt it in some way or another. And, of course, there were many other things that were happening in American society in the ’60s, both domestically and with Vietnam and so on. And all of those things had a play on what Americans were thinking and how they were feeling and so on. But, quite a time. Quite a time."

        "utterance": "Well, that’s interesting because I became the, what they called the U.S. Technical Director. I was basically the Technical Director, the Program Manager for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project [ASTP]. And, it was an interesting assignment because, you know, I got to go to the Soviet Union in October of ’70 on our first exploratory meeting. And, you know, it’s kind of spooky. I was frankly intimidated by it. I mean, it was kind of gray and dark and snowy; and people, you know, seemed a little bit—the people you met on the streets weren’t friendly. And there was this place, Red Square, you know, that we had seen so many clips of and associated with generally a threat of sorts.\\n\\n So, it was quite an eye-opener for me. I was—whatever I was at the time, 33, 34 years old. And within a year or so, I was the U.S. Technical Director for this project that was bridging this—was one of the bridges that President [Richard M.] Nixon and Henry [A.] Kissinger, Secretary of State, were trying to arrange to—to help change the complexion of this competition that had been so fierce between the Soviet Union and us. And who knows what—what the effects of that were? I leave that to the historians, not just of ASTP but of just the general approach that the United States government began to try. And we were a piece of that. And I recognized, going in, that that was the case. That we were a piece of this much larger effort to kind of change the rules of the game somehow, so that it wasn’t as threatening or as hostile as it was before. And that didn’t happen overnight, and probably other circumstances later on contributed to other things that changed it dramatically here in the last—in the ’90s. Changed it very dramatically compared to where it was in the ’60s.\\n\\n And in one sense, if that were a—a competition or a crisis or a conflict—I leave the word “war” out of it, in terms of, perhaps, a Cold War the space race was an important part of that. And, you know, we won our part. There were a lot of other parts that a lot of other people contributed to, but this was the part that I had something to do with. And we won our part. And then we went off to do this thing called Apollo-Soyuz. As a matter of fact, Tom Stafford was the commander for it. And I had worked with Tom, of course, on previous flights in a flight director capacity, and now I was working with him as a American leader for this activity.\\n\\n It was quite a different thing for me. And at my age, probably still not, you know—still I had a very American orientation in terms of the way I thought about things. It was quite an interesting thing to go through to go to another place and then begin to try to occasionally put yourself in the other person’s shoes. In other words, in trying to make some accommodation or understand what was going on or why it was going on. To kind of consciously try to work at putting myself in the other guy’s shoes and trying to understand what he was doing, or what they were doing, and why they were doing it, and how we could respond to it in the most constructive way. It was quite a—I mean, it was a learning experience for me.\\n\\n When I went—got involved with things, I mean, the relationship with media was—is entirely different over there than it was over here. They could not believe, you know, what the goings on were between we representatives of the U.S. government and the American media. And they had quite a difficult time in understanding it. I mean, their basic problem was that, as they stated to me—was their—they like the way theirs was because they knew who was in control of the media. In our case, they didn’t know who was in control of the media that they ran into. As a matter of fact, the media all seemed to be kind of different to them. But they had this problem with not understanding who was behind the media and, that is, in control of them. So, they didn’t quite know how to deal with them. They weren’t—they clearly weren’t in the same camp as, in our case, the U.S. government. And over there they, the media’s, just an arm of the government. So, they understood very clearly who was control of them."

        "utterance": "I—let me answer that question in two ways. Number one, in terms of the people that we met. We found them to be very competent at what they did. They’re very good at it. They tended to live in a world where they were more compartmentalized than we were. But, by that I mean technically compartmentalized. But they’re more like an engineering department, you know; there’s docking specialists and radio specialists. In our operation, we have a lot of people like me who were sort of operations oriented so that we got us across all the different departments within all these compartments. So, we had a chance to see that. But I would say I was impressed by the technical people that they had. And, frankly, what they achieved.\\n\\n I was impressed at their perseverance. I was impressed at—they had an ability to do what they had to do with the tools that they had. They did not have the fancy computers, the analytical models that we are so fond of and that we used to save a lot of hardware and a lot of testing. On the other hand, they went for hardware and testing. And it was the situation they were in, and they made the very best of it. And we’ve evolved a little bit past that. You know, sometimes that’s good and sometimes it has its drawbacks. That is the position we’re in today. But the people, I was impressed by. They were sound. They knew what they were doing. They still—you still always had a flavor of kind of compartments and sort of restraints on them, much more so than I felt existed in our system, although that might’ve been a personal bias. But they were good. They were good at what they did.\\n\\n Now the hardware. I was often asked when I was—when I’d come back from a trip, especially by our media—and remember this is 1972, 1973, Vietnam is still struggling and so on—there was, I was generally asked questions, especially by our media, that had to do with comparing technology. And the questions were usually phrased in such a way as to invite me to criticize their technology and to praise ours. And I found, after a while, that that just—from the beginning actually—that just didn’t seem appropriate. They operated in a different kind of an environment than we did. They had different priorities than we did. So, they would do things that were consistent with that. But their hardware was effective. It did the job that they had designed it to do. And it did it reasonably well.\\n\\n I mean, they’ve had a tremendous record with their Soyuz launch vehicle, for example. They just launch those things, launch those things, launch those things, and they work pretty well. They do not have some of the sophistication that we have in terms of onboard computers, and that is a fact. They don’t have that. But, recognizing that they didn’t have that much of an—apparently an industrial capacity in that regard as we do, a lot of ours, by the way, is generated today by our commercial interests in the field where their society was all driven by their, you know,—their military or technical requirements for things. But aside from that, they would do things that might seem crude to some of our people. If they didn’t have to worry about something, they didn’t go away polishing it. I’m talking about metal finishes on things. They didn’t waste time with what they considered to be frills, what we would consider to be, you know, completing a job or whatever.\\n\\n But on the other hand, the stuff worked. I mean, it worked for the purposes it was designed, and it worked pretty well. I think they—their progress probably suffered from the lack of the computer capability that we have in this country. They just do not have the same kind of capacity that I ever saw. And—but other than that, they built hardware that did the job that it was supposed to do. I still have this sense that their system operated in kind of compartments and constraints, probably consistent with what you would consider to be an apparatus to put high degree of tension or high priority on national security and classifications of various kinds. Need to knows and so on. It was almost like they carried that to an extreme. It may have actually hurt them a little bit in terms of the full capability that—their capacity that they might otherwise have arrived at. But that’s hard—that’s speculation. It’s hard to tell that.\\n\\n So, the people I was impressed with. They were always good. The technology although—I think the most obvious example where our technology was far more advanced was the computer field. But other than that, their hardware did the job it was designed to do. They have flown this Mir space station for now probably 12 years, 13 years. They’ve flown a lot of flights up to it. The launch vehicles have had a terrific record. The spacecraft have had a good record. They’ve had some trouble with rendezvous and docking, but I think most of those problems have been manifested in the computer area—in the general area that you and I would call computers. They seem to have some trouble with their flight control systems and the logic systems onboard. All in the general electronics area, what you and I might call their computer industry. But I was impressed.\\n\\n I was also impressed in their—in the kind of dogged perseverance and the way in which they applied these things. I mean, we worked with guys who were in the Tank Corps in World War II. And, you know, they used to just strap 50-gallon diesel barrels on their tanks, take them into combat, and then when they got close to the fight, they would just roll the tanks off, roll the 50-gallon drums off the tanks and proceed. So, they kind of adapted what they had and made the very most of it. And they did it in a very tough kind of persevering kind of a way. Physically tough. Mentally tough. They lived in a very tough system. So, they kind of had a way of dealing with it and, you know, developed these shells for shielding themselves from some of these realities. But that was a form of protection, and it manifested itself as kind of a toughness."

Alex’s family was in royal circles; that is, in the Czar’s circles for several decades—maybe centuries, for all I know. And his dad—his father was the ambassador to Germany from the—of the Czar at the time of the Revolution. So, his family was involved in these things, and Alex had a natural interest in Russian history. And he knew more about Russia than the people that we would be talking to usually.\\n\\n And it was interesting to walk down the street with him in Moscow. The ladies that we came to call “the babushka ladies”—no disrespect but that was what they looked like, the little old ladies—when they walked by Alex, they always kind of sort of nodded at him in a deferential way as if they detected somebody from the old school and were paying some respect to it. But anyway, the point of that is Alex—he was about 70 at the time. He left his home country at the time of the Revolution because his class was being thrown out by the Bolsheviks. And he came, via a variety of paths, through Paris and sang over there for a while. Had a job with one of the government agencies until [Joseph R.] McCarthy got him. McCarthy not directly, but the effects of the McCarthy Era got him. So, he was—had a number of bitter experiences in his life. And, frankly, probably a lot of them. And then when he got involved in this, he seemed to take it as a mission to help his former country in this way. And I say that because, this was an older gentleman at the time, 70-ish, who knew a lot about the Russians, had been in the State Department, had been an interpreter, I think, for the State Department also.\n\nAlex—"

        "utterance": "——Alex kind of knew the Russian history, knew the people, knew the pressures, knew the current situation. And he knew a lot about their psychology and so on. And he helped me a great deal with negotiations. There were times when he would kind of pull me aside and say, “Glynn, you’re pushing this subject too hard. He needs time, my counterpart needs time to go work it internally. So, give him some room.” You know, and suggestions like that. And it turned out to be very helpful. But it also then turned out to just keep enhancing my understanding of what I was dealing with. Because by, you know—as this thing got rolling, we had several hundreds of people on our side and their side interacting regularly in meetings and technical exchanges and so on. But we started with a relatively small team, and we kind of added to it as we went. So, we kind of had a consistency of how we went about things.\\n\\n For example, one of the things we used to try to do was, we always preplanned the outcome of any meeting to the extent of writing the minutes that would constitute the record of the meeting. So that when we went into a meeting with the Russians, we knew full well ahead of time what our going in intentions were in terms of an outcome. Sometimes surprises occurred. You know, new things could be introduced; so we could react to those. But we created this discipline of, “Don’t go into any meetings unless you can write the minutes ahead of time and tell how you want it to come out.” And we did that. And it worked pretty well for us.\\n\\n And people—all the people in the team started to carry that around as a mode of operation in their head, which is a little bit different. Although you should do that in terms of domestic activities, too. You’ve got to have a good idea of outcomes before you get involved in some—or at least your desire to them—to the outcomes. But anyway, it worked pretty well. And we kept it on a really a technical basis and a professional basis. And the personal basis things were all positive. In other words, we went out of our way not to ever give the impression that we were idly curious about anything that they were doing. We avoided, you know, random fishing trip lines of discussion and questions and so on. We could always relate what we were doing to the success of the mission or the safety of the mission; and those were the things that worked for them, and so on. And over time, they became convinced that we were—even if they couldn’t sometimes understand why we wanted to know something—they became convinced that we had a reason and it was acceptable—it would be an acceptable reason. That we weren’t fishing. And we weren’t, you know, trying to learn things about them that they—that weren’t relevant or that they didn’t want to tell us about, and so on and so.\\n\\n But we also insisted that we know what we wanted to know, and we were adamant about it. I mean, to the point of saying, “Look, you guys don’t get this for us, we’re calling this meeting off and going home!” And sometimes that worked immediately; sometimes it took a little time. They had the accident where the three crewmen were killed because the vehicle depressurized coming down. I’ve forgotten what the Soyuz designation was. Well, that was a high-priority thing for us to understand because it reflected on the life support system in the Soyuz, which would have effects on us. Now, they did not want to talk about that. And it took, probably, two or three meetings to get an answer. But we were adamant that we get an answer to that question or we’d call this thing off! And it was interesting because, in the American system, I did not feel any political pressure from anybody. I mean, I didn’t feel like anybody was pulling on my chain or constraining me or accelerating me in any way. We proceeded at a pace that was appropriate for the program, and we stayed within those bounds.\\n\\n On their side, they felt a different sense of—they had this expression of “decisions that are made on high,” you know, at whatever level. They had to respond to those as if they were, you know, down from the Mount, written on stone; and they didn’t feel like they had any flexibility or any—and to do anything that would challenge that or threaten it or put it at risk was just not going to happen on their part. So, it took us about two or three meetings to realize that they were in that political situation and we were in a better one; that is, they were on the hook to the decision-makers on high to make this thing come out well. So were we, but we had more of a—my sense was, we had more of a system that would understand if we decided something wasn’t acceptable and wanted to call a halt or make a big stink about something.\\n\\n They didn’t seem to have—I don’t think they had—felt that they had that kind of flexibility. Their system operated on orders down. So, it took us about three meetings to figure out what exactly was their system; and I don’t know how we actually got there, but we were always trying to piece together what was motivating them and what was driving them and what would work on them and what would not work. We gradually figured out that the political system in which they work was such that it really became the leverage by which we ended up conducting the rest of the mission. Because we felt like we were in the driver’s seat, we could insist on knowing the things we needed to know. And they eventually, sometimes with pain, complied and came forward with those explanations.\\n\\n Like the one the three cosmonauts who were killed because the vehicle depressurized. It reflected on potentially the life support system. But we finally got an explanation of that, and a very credible one that fit with all of the data and the information that they had provided us. And it was an achievement on their part—on our counterparts to get permission. We viewed it as an achievement in their system for them to get permission, because they would’ve told us if it were up to themselves. But they didn’t have clearance, if that’s the right word, to tell us about it. So, they had to go argue with whoever was wanting to keep that secret. They had to go argue with them. And they got it! And it took two or three meetings, but they got it. And we made it clear that we needed to know answers to those kind of questions.\\n\\n But we kept it on a program basis. We kept it on a technical, professional, it had to relate to the program, was not fishing trips; but we recognized the leverage that we had on them because of the difference in our two political systems. I mean, I was no less responsible to our political leaders, but it didn’t feel the same to me as I was interpreting it that they perceived it to be on their side. So, it gave us some leverage in this whole thing that worked to our advantage."

The language and jargon was such that you couldn’t just move people in and out who were good at both languages. They had to—it was kind of a specialized language. And the interpreters could provide significant help, because, in my cases, the interpreters on our side had family or were first- or second-generation removed from having lived in the old Russia. As in the case of Alex Tetischev. So, he helped a great deal with that.\\n\\n But, there were other things. Like, we have this tendency to document things. They have a tendency—I think it’s part of this compartmentalization thing—they tend not to document and make available to a wider audience, you know, a set of schematics even or procedures or training manuals. They tend to keep it within a group, and it’s some—it almost feels like sometimes that the group retains control by not documenting the “what they’re doings” and “how it works.” So, they just continue to have control. It’s a priesthood of sorts around this sacred knowledge that only they then can dispense as they go forward. This is a little bit of sense that that’s the way they operate. Internally, amongst themselves. And then, of course, that’s the way they did it with us.\\n\\n But we have this tendency to document, as you know, to a fault. And we also have this sense of creating a set of program documentation that describes all of the “how’s this going to work” and “who’s going to work with whom” and “how do we work together” and raar-raar-raar. They just didn’t feel like they had that kind of a thought process. But to their credit, I mean I don’t know how I would’ve felt if I were in their shoes. But they accepted a lot of the things that we insisted had to be done to be sure that we could document the program, document all the things we had to do, and so on. And have schedules for them, and keep them on track. They—sometimes reluctantly, but by and large—they went along with all of the things that we felt were necessary to do that. And it probably was a little bit of a little swallowing of—on their part to accept that. But they did it\\n\\n And they again had this—they wanted to make the mission work, and they were willing to do what they had to do to do that. And part of that was keeping peace with us, which was part of this political motivation that we began to understand. And it was helpful for us to get a better feeling for the system that they lived in and what was motivating them, because it gave us a better strategy—a better idea about strategies for how to play into that and what would work."

        "utterance": "Well, there always has to be a first time. So had we not done that, I imagine that we could’ve done the Apollo—done the Space Station thing because it would’ve been the first time. And a lot of the people were new, certainly on our side. There were more on their side, by the way, that were carryovers from the old days, from the Apollo-Soyuz, than on our side. So, I think it could’ve worked. Now NASA, to its credit, went about this participation with the Russians in kind of a two-stage approach. They’ve done this Mir activity, where we’ve had people onboard Mir for considerable lengths of time. And I have said before that the Mir activity is a little bit like Gemini with the Space Station being the equivalent of Apollo.\\n\\n So, the Mir turns out to be a way to learn all the current technical activities, systems, and so on and the interactions with the control centers and all that, with the current crop of players and the current crop of tools and techniques for doing that. And that’s going to serve NASA and the country and the whole program, including the Russians, well in terms of getting ready to do the International Space Station. Because the Mir has been a big learning platform for our folks. And they are—the Russian motivation is now different than it used to be. I mean, I have explained that, at least briefly, what I felt was their motivation and how we took advantage of it. Today their motivations are very different. They don’t have the same sense of the political mandate that they did before. On the other hand, they are driven by an economic and financial one more than they ever—more than were in our time. That didn’t occur to them in our time. But now they’re driven by more of that. So, you know, that’s another potential understanding and, therefore, leverage point that our people could be—can be—I don’t want to say “exploiting,” but using to their advantage. But it’s different. But I think they could’ve done that. I think Apollo-Soyuz certainly enhanced that. I have used this analogy to describe it a number of times, Roy.\\n\\n Apollo-Soyuz was a process of making deposits in a bank account. Every time we were honest and straightforward and sincere, we kind of made a deposit. And over the course of the Apollo-Soyuz mission, by the time the flight was conducted, I think we had a substantial bank account of goodwill, where they would certainly give us the benefit of their doubt, and a quite a bit of goodwill. So, we built up this bank account. And I think that’ll have to go on today. And it’s been going on. I mean, we’ve done a lot of things to help them with the Mir situation, for example. And I think that builds a bank account that then becomes something that people can draw on in the future, you know, when times get a little tougher and so on. But we built up a good one in Apollo-Soyuz, and I think that served the country well when we got around to these discussions about the Space Station.\\n\\n I think there was, you know, a residual or a—certainly a sense amongst a lot of the people who had been involved in it or had heard about it; and it was generally perceived in their country to be a very positive, very successful, very good thing for them. And therefore, it had a lot of positive vibes around it. And it probably made it easier for them to consider, and then easier for them to deal with, the Space Station; a new application of the same idea."

        "utterance": "Well, let’s see. In 1975, we flew the Apollo-Soyuz in, say, July. And then we had a team of people that had just pulled this thing off; and it was not a large number of people, but it was a fairly tight-knit, technically strong group of people. And Chris, who was the Center Director at the time, of course had the Shuttle Development Program under way. Bob [Robert F.] Thompson was running it. Aaron Cohen was running the Orbiter Office. Bob was running the Space Shuttle Office. And the—a lot of the Center was very much occupied with that activity. Chris [Kraft] had the idea, though, that we, JSC [Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas], would be developing quite a few of the payloads that would fly onboard the Shuttle; that is, that we would be in the—you read my title, it includes development. He thought that there would be a lot of payloads and, in effect, business for the Johnson Space Center to win that would amount to new work, new starts, and so on, building these payloads. And I think that was the thing that he had in mind when he went into it. And—but, frankly, so did we because we didn’t know any better.\\n\\n But once we got involved in it, especially once we started the deal with the commercial communications satellite industry and the Department of Defense, we began to see ourselves more as not so much a developer of payloads, but as a kind of a accommodater of payload interests and an organization that was trying to find ways to accommodate their requirements in as reasonable a way as possible. Let me just give you a technical example of what I mean by that.\\n\\n When we walked into it, the Orbiter was designed with a lot of electrical capability, wires and so on, that would be made available to payloads. So, we walked into this and said, “Okay, well now, where are the electrical accommodations for the payloads?” Well, on the back of the bulkhead of the cockpit, where the payload bay starts, there was a big plate, about this big, and it must’ve had about 100 or more connectors in it. And they said, “Well, there it is there. You just plug in, you know, your wires into one of those.” So, here we were, faced with a system that wanted to fly multiple satellites, multiple payloads—three, four, five at a time—on missions on turnaround times that were measured in short, relatively short period of times, you know. So, the accommodation was: here’s this massive connector base, and we’re going to thread everybody’s wires that they want from their payload to here and then not use them up in such a way that when we manifest another payload with it, we’ve still got all the ones they need and so on.\\n\\n So, you know, it was clear that we had not gotten to really think about how we would service four communications satellites in a cargo bay who all wanted a relatively minimal amount of service, but they wanted it to be easy and something they could repeat every time and that. So, it took us a while to bridge between where we had left the design of the Orbiter, for example, in its design stage to really being something that we could accommodate the payloads as they were being configured and likely to fly onboard the Shuttle. And the truth is, the guys who had designed the Orbiter didn’t know. I mean, they hadn’t interfaced with it and they didn’t know. So, we were put in a position of realizing that that was a big gap and beginning to develop the techniques that took all those connectors, divided them up into four, made four standard connectors at four locations in the cargo bay so that four communications satellites could stack up and use the same arrangements every time without having to rewire a bunch of things from their payload up to the back end of this wall, and so on and so on.\\n\\n So, our biggest learning was in trying to figure out how to handle the different kind of payloads that show up—that were starting to show up for Shuttle. And they were in three categories. There were a set of NASA payloads; and, in some respects, they were a little difficult to deal with. Difficult—there was some resistance to the Shuttle within NASA at the other Centers. And it spilled over into some of these discussions in an—unfortunately.\\n\\n There was the Department of Defense, who also was being kind of—our decisions were made at high levels that the DoD was going to get on the Shuttle and Shuttle was going to be the only vehicle for economic reasons and so on. So, the blue suit folks who had been flying their payloads all along kind of resented that. And it was a difficult accommodation to make for them, and difficult for us to figure out what was motivating them and try to keep them happy and so on. But it was a learning experience for us.\\n\\n And the one that was the easiest to deal with was the communication satellites. Because they had somewhat the same interest we did. “Look, we want this interface to be simple. We want us to be able to repeat it every time we do it. We don’t want it to be complicated or expensive.” And we’ve learned a great deal by dealing with those folks, learned a great deal in terms of what needs to be done, what should be done, and so on. And they represented kind of like the minimum standard that a commercial view would derive for services. So, they—usually requiring less than, or even far less than, the NASA payloads, who’ve got a lot of civil service guys who could sit and dream up a lot of stuff; likewise on the Department of Defense side. They were used to a certain amount of servicing, and they had a lot of people who expected to get the same thing here on the Shuttle side. So, it was a learning experience for us in finding these different categories or camps of potential customers for the Shuttle, and then figuring out how to price it, and how to prorate it amongst users who weren’t using up a full Shuttle flight, etc. It was quite a learning experience for us.\\n\\n We learned about the effects of—or the strategy of using insurance. The communication satellite people used insurance as a hedge, you know, if something went wrong with—the government doesn’t do that. DoD doesn’t do it and so on. But it was a new idea for us, to find out about insurance and how it worked and how people used it. It was interesting to find out that people who came to fly in the Shuttle came from other countries. And just as we found in the case of the Russians, and maybe because of our experience with that, we were sensitive to the fact that they would have pressures on them that we would not even think of. You know, and we wouldn’t know exactly what they were; but we tried to operate in a way that respected the fact and the likelihood that they have pressures operating on them that are different from any we know, and different than any we could sit around here and think up. Therefore, we have to be careful how we deal with them, and we have to respect their degrees of freedom in trying to make decisions and make choices and so on.\\n\\n As a matter of fact, I remember—do you remember when we had the flight when the nozzle—well, it turned out the nozzle fell off? And one of the PALAPA or the other one that went up that failed and—I guess it was a WESTAR failed in Earth orbit? It was a communication satellite that it turned out the nozzle fell off the motor that we had—fell off, broke off—and the satellite was stranded in Earth orbit. Well, the next guys up to do the exact same thing, on the same flight, were from Indonesia with the PALAPA. Well, all of our well-intended NASA hierarchy all wanted to put the arm on these guys not to deploy. And my reaction was, “Look! This is their decision to make. You have no idea what’s going on in their country. You have no idea how much they may need this communication satellite. You have no idea what position these men, who are making this decision, are with respect to their powers-that-be back home. You have no understanding of their insurance. You have no understanding of anything here, except this technical stuff that you think you know all about. Butt out! Leave them alone! Let them make their own decision!”\\n\\n And it was something that we learned, maybe starting with Apollo-Soyuz. I never thought about it that way. But we learned from dealing with them. And the NASA people who did not deal very much with payloads had this tendency to come in and just lard the NASA wisdom, whatever it was at the time, all over these people. And, you know, they had their own world to deal with and their own constraints. And we always tried to protect them. I mean, we tried internally with the NASA—the rest of the NASA system to protect them and give them what they wanted, and not get into their decision-making. It was their choice. A very difficult transition for NASA, who is a control and doing organization. Very difficult for them to get around to accepting that."

So, I was for 4 years, from ’81 to ’85, and we flew about 17 or 18 flights in that timeframe. And we went from, you know, the first couple of what we called OFT, orbital flight test, two men, ejection seats, and so on. And then we began to try to put the system in place that could handle all of the different customers who were going to fly in the Shuttle at an increasing flight rate and so on; and that was on the way. But—I guess I left in about June of ’85—but it was really stopped and changed by the fallout from the Challenger [51-L] accident in January of ’86."

We made a lot of progress with the Department of Defense, with the Air Forces, their agent. We flew a couple of missions for them, and we had a lot of good things in progress. The communications satellite stuff was working very well. The NASA payload stuff was working well. Spacelab was working well—the thing that the Europeans developed that we eventually came to own and take over—we, the United States, came to own and take over—and bought another one from them. All those things were working pretty well.\\n\\n I don’t think it was—I don’t think operating the Shuttle system was anywhere near as easy as people perceived and imagined it to be when they set about the decision process that said, “Shuttle’s going to be the only launch vehicle, and we’ll fly it 30 or 40 times a year,” or whatever. That—you know, that would’ve been a giant strain if not impossible. I mean, you can do anything with enough money. But it would’ve been a very difficult thing to do. And it’s an example of people getting trapped into financial arguments. In other words, the Space Shuttle was conceived as the next step, a way to shuttle up and down to a space station, and so on and so on. And then for funding, budgeting, Washington-oriented kind of reasons, the investment had to be justified on the basis of a payback, which then became cloaked in a picture that said, “The Shuttle can do anything for everybody, and it’ll fly as many times as you want a year, and it’ll be very cheap.” It was kind of a—I don’t want to say “a political answer,” but it was almost a political position NASA took early on to justify the development of the Space Shuttle Program. And it became then an anchor around our neck for a long time, trying to live up to promises that people made to justify the system 10 years earlier. Which were difficult, if not impossible to meet in a lot of cases."

        "utterance": "Well, the press of the business at the time of the accident was probably pretty high. And it was compounded by—we were working—the accident happened in January. The Challenger accident happened in January. In May of that year, May of ’86, we were going to fly two Centaur-propelled interplanetary vehicles within a month or less of each other, so that the schedule had been just driven by flying these Centaur stages. And I say “Centaur.” What I really mean is these were going to be stages that had hydrogen and oxygen inside them, inside the cargo bay. Represented a considerable risk that, you know, we tried to be very sensitive to and deal with. And then we had a set of safety requirements for them. We had to dump the propellants in case of an abort, and a complicated set of stuff. We’d have been better off not having to fly the Centaur and its payloads at all. But, the system was operated in a Washington-dictated environment that said, “The Shuttle’s going to fly everything. And certainly it’s going to fly these NASA payloads. And if these NASA payloads need this hydrogen-oxygen stage, unless you can prove that it can’t be done, then we will decide to do it.” So, we were in the position of never being able to prove you can’t do it. But it got to be quite a load.\\n\\n Now, had we been flying communication satellites, I think we could’ve flown lots of flights with communication satellites and not had a problem. The problem we got into was that certain NASA missions and certain DoD missions, because they’re represented expensive projects, required expensive treatment. Which takes both money and time. And therefore, you know, if you’re trying to run a railroad and somebody comes in and wants to change all the seats and all the cargo—size of the cargo vehicles you have all the time, it gets kind of difficult.\\n\\n So, we had a little bit of a expectations problem in the sense that, we had this expectation of running a railroad with a lot of routine stuff, delivering coal, you know, or something, cars. And then there were people over here on this side, who were going to use the Shuttle, didn’t have the same conception of it. They wanted quite elaborate treatment of their payloads. Quite expensive treatment in terms of time or whatever. And they had a right to say that, because they might be representing a very expensive, important, strategically important even, satellite; and therefore, they needed more servicing the communications satellite guys. Or at least felt that they did. So, it was kind of like a dichotomy or a conflict. It never really got resolved until it went away as a result of the accident. The requirement to handle all this other traffic was deleted.\\n\\n The need to do that was deleted. NASA was sent back to the drawing board in effect and told, “Look run your own program internally. Don’t fly any communications satellites.” And the DoD made a DoD decision to get off it, based on the accident, and maintain a set of independent launch vehicles; which, by the way, I felt all along was a reasonable position for the country to take. The concept that all space traffic had to flow through the Shuttle cargo bay, to me, even as the Manager of the Customer Office and as the Manager of the Space Shuttle Program Office, that didn’t make any sense to me. Now I—people did that because they felt that they wouldn’t get any unless they forced it. You know, they wouldn’t get any cooperation in terms of the government payloads. But, you know, it just to me never did make good sense that people should put all their eggs into the one single basket. And it tended to overload the basket.\\n\\n Interestingly enough, the DoD has, by jumping off the Shuttle, done exactly the same thing on another launch vehicle. Just this time, they happen to control it so they’re somewhat more comfortable with it. But they went back and put everything back on the Titan, and they don’t have anything that’s hardly—that’s compatible with the Shuttle anymore."

But, I think the Center people gradually became more aware that what they were doing with the Shuttle, although to them it was an end, at a larger level of looking at it, it’s a means—the Shuttle is a means to an end. And then the experiences that we had with the communication satellite industry, with the Department of Defense, and some of the NASA payloads, the people here at JSC who worked it from a Shuttle payloads point of view and a Shuttle point of view became much more sensitive to and supportive of the cargo activity that other people were. And by the way, not unlike the transformation that occurred when the operations team really began to engage the scientific community on the lunar science work.\\n\\n You know, at first our priority was to land. But then having done that, and the point landing, then it became a logical sequence to start working with the people who represented the science and really get onboard that; and we did that. In this case, the Center, JSC, was consumed in the ’70s and early ’80s with developing the Space Shuttle, and they had no—the bulk of the people, the majority of the people, had had not much time to think about what it was going to be used for. They then began to engage all these different organizations that represent these different payloads. And I think most people who flew on the Shuttle—most organizations that had satellites or whatever that flew on the Shuttle—at the end of it, looking back, were pleased with the experience. I mean, I’m saying that. That may not be universally true. But I always had the sense of that with people, that after they went through it. But on the front end looking into it, all they could see was a hedgerow of difficulties. Bureaucratic, to them, difficulties that they didn’t understand what we were doing or why. Or, \"why did we have to do this?\" Or, \"why did we have to do that?\" But when they got all the way through and flew, especially those folks who might’ve had problems during the flight.\\n\\n I think one of the outstanding organizations that we dealt with was Hughes, Hughes Communications Satellite Company [Hughes Electronics Corporation]—whatever their title was. They’re a crackerjack outfit. Technically, they were very good. But they were very can-do. We had several incidences—well, like, retrieving the two satellites that I talked about a minute ago, WESTAR and PALAPA. You know, we did that with the Hughes people, how to retrieve them, what to do with them, and so on. How to go about that. Hughes had the SYNCOM, a satellite where it failed to fire. It failed to fire. We went out and did this flyswatter thing and in effect it didn’t work, but it eliminated what would have been the conclusion as the cause. So, if we didn’t do that, we’d have been off working on the wrong solution.\\n\\n We went back and fixed a bunch of stuff up, and flew a mission—Joe [H.] Engle flew in the summer of ’85—that actually recovered that satellite and got it on the way. And Hughes was a crackerjack outfit that way. And that interplay, because they were the predominant communications satellite player, plus they built a lot of DoD satellites, was really beginning to pay off for us. Because they were, in effect, similar to the NASA people in terms of response to a challenge. I mean, they just stepped right up to it and did it. And, you know, gangbusters. No tentativeness. No timidity. When they decided they were going to do something, they just went for it. And in that respect, similar to a lot of the people in the organization culture at NASA.\\n\\n That was a good relationship. It was paying good dividends, and would’ve paid even bigger ones in the future. But then it all turned off with the Challenger."

        "utterance": "An interesting situation at Lockheed, where I was losing my young female engineers after about four or five years of experience, and they were leaving to take lesser paying jobs—they loved their jobs, they loved what they were doing at Lockheed, but they were leaving to take lower paying jobs. I thought this was not right, I don’t understand this. So, I started doing exit interviews, and there were four or five of them that did this, and I was completely shocked to hear the reason was they didn’t see any female senior managers, no vice presidents, no directors.\\n\\n A 17,000-engineer company, Space Systems Company, and it hadn’t dawned on me, because I was vice president, and the senior staff was about a third female, but they were HR [Human Resources] and finance and diversity and so forth. No technical jobs were held by females, it turns out, and they said there was no vice presidents and no directors the next level down, females. I said, “Well, that can’t be right.” I checked, and out of a 17,000-person company we had one female director, who was shortly brought up to corporate headquarters, so we had zero, and I hadn’t noticed that because we had a lot of female engineers, they just weren’t in senior management positions. But these young girls had noticed that and assumed there was a glass ceiling and they couldn’t advance.\\n\\n I was stunned, because we were paying them extremely well. These were design engineers that are paid pretty well. That was a real education for me, to find out you really need to see somebody like you in a senior position to believe you can advance in a company. So that’s one of the things they asked me to talk about today at this panel. We’ll see what else they want to get into."

        "utterance": "Well, it was a really fun mission. It basically had two parts to it. One was the Air Force payload, which consisted of a bunch of sensors in the payload bay that they wanted to map and identify the aurora, in our case the Aurora Australis, the southern lights. Two of the crew members, Guy [Guion S.] Bluford and [Charles] Lacy Veach, had trained for a long time on these instruments, how to operate them. They were actually assigned before the rest of the crew, so they’d been working on this for some time. The other part was for the Star Wars people, the Strategic Defense Initiative, which turned out to be how I met Mike [Michael D.] Griffin.\\n\\n Mike was the deputy for technical for the Strategic Defense Initiative office, but everybody called it the Star Wars office. The idea for that one was to map what a rocket plume looked like in space. I think there were five different sensors on this platform that we were going to deploy. The idea was to command this platform and the sensors to look back at the [Space] Shuttle while we fired the Orbital Maneuvering System engine, the OMS engine, so they could map what a rocket plume looked like. The idea was to be able to develop satellites and sensors that would see a rocket coming up very quickly, detect it, and track it so they could, obviously, destroy it.\\n\\n That’s how I got to meet Mike Griffin. His first words to me were, “There’s a $25 billion program riding on the data you get, so don’t screw it up. No pressure, now.” It was fun for me as a crewman; not only did we get to fly through the Aurora Australis—and back then, having a high-inclination flight was pretty unusual. Now it’s very common because everybody goes to the [International] Space Station, which is pretty high inclination, but back then it was unusual, and that was pretty special for us, but also for a pilot to be able to do a rendezvous in space was pretty neat.\\n\\n Of course now everybody goes to the Space Station, or did, so no big deal, but back then it was pretty unusual. For me it was fun, because we got to deploy this satellite, fly away from it about three to five miles, command it to point back at us, and then I got to fire the Shuttle’s engines. We’d go out of plane, out of the orbital plane, point out of plane, fire the engines, and immediately flip around and fire them again to get back in plane, if you will. We got to do a lot of fun maneuvering in space that we don’t usually get to do with the Shuttle.\\n\\n That was really special for us, to be able to do a lot of different maneuvers, and then do the rendezvous and pick up the satellite with all the data it had on it. It was pretty important to get the data. It was a really unique and, I think, challenging mission to do all that, but it was a real privilege to be able to fly a mission like that. We got back, and Mike contacted us a little while later and said we got more data than we ever dreamed, so mission accomplished. That was really special. That’s how I got to know Mike, working with him. Eventually that’s how he contacted me about the Center Director job.\\n\\n That was a fun mission. It was exhausting. The rendezvous was unusual. In the training, the simulator wouldn’t stay up for a whole rendezvous, it kept crashing, so we’d do the first half, and then the last half, and we never did end-to-end rendezvous and capture. Not that it really mattered, because we had all the pieces practiced well, but when you get up into space, of course, it’s not going to crash, the visual doesn’t go down. But, it was a good thing we had a lot of practice, because we lost the rendezvous radar that gave us ranging, and then we lost a couple of the cameras that were the backup.\\n\\n In the payload bay you have cameras that point from each end, and you can track the approaching satellite, or as you approach it, and get range rate that way. We lost a couple of cameras, and we’re going, “Well, things are failing pretty fast here.” The joke was, “Well, hopefully the visual won’t fail.”\\n\\n It actually turned out to work very well for us. We were very fuel limited, we didn’t have a whole lot of gas, because we’d done a lot of maneuvers, we were firing engines, which was the whole purpose of the flight. So, doing the rendezvous, we were worried about the amount of fuel we had left. Turns out, when you don’t have a whole lot of data coming in, you don’t make a whole lot of inputs and fire your engines, because you want to wait and make sure you’re either going too fast or too slow coming in. We ended up doing a pretty fuel-efficient rendezvous, and it worked out pretty well. A lot of that was Rick [Richard J.] Hieb, who was the guy doing the range and range-rate callouts for me while I was flying. He did a wonderful job with all the backup systems we had.\\n\\n That was pretty exciting, because then we got to rendezvous and capture this SPAS [-II, Shuttle Pallet Satellite-II] that was built over in Germany with all the sensors on it that had the data. Turned out that we saved enough fuel that we were able to do quite a bit of activities on the contingency list, which was also fun, because every crew wants to accomplish as much as you possibly can on a mission. It allowed us to get a lot of things done that we wanted to get done, so that was a fun mission.\\n\\n Of course flying through the aurora—can you imagine being in the cockpit floating, you darken the cockpit, no lights, and here you are flying through this thousands of mile long, 400-mile-high curtain of light that’s dancing around, and you’re just going, “Oh, man, I wish we could capture this on film.” We just didn’t have film that was fast enough to capture what you’re seeing. You can take pictures of it, of course, long-exposure pictures, but boy, that was just a pretty special moment, to do that."

My first crew, Hank [Henry W.] Hartsfield was the commander, and he was the only one that had flown before. We were all rookies. I learned to feel sorry for Hank, because he didn’t have another veteran on the crew to help out. But, that was not quite as complicated a flight as the later ones out there."

Most of the Air Force [Program] 675 payload was not classified, which was neat, because we could talk about that to anybody. But, we did have some classified work, and Guy was the expert on that, and I had been back up. That was one of the bones of contention. The Air Force didn’t want anybody else on the crew to know about a certain payload, and I said, “Well, when everybody’s crowded together on the flight deck and they see something go poof, they’re going to notice. I can’t tell them to close their eyes. It doesn’t work that way up there. I’m going to tell them what they need to know, if no details about it.” We had a lot of discussions about that. Naturally, with any classified payload or program, they want to compartmentalize and keep it as tight as they can, which is the right thing to do, but you’re also faced with the real world, where you just can’t stuff people in a locker up in space and say don’t listen, either. We had some good discussions, and they finally agreed, they came around. It wasn’t that big a deal, frankly, but there was some classified work that we did for the Air Force up there."

        "utterance": "It was a bit of a concern. Guy was a real devoted runner, and he had developed some back problems, probably from all the running, the pounding that he’d done. He wanted to put off any kind of surgery until after the mission, but about eight months before the flight, six or eight months, he started to develop some numbness in his left leg, and the doctor said, “Ooh, that’s serious. That means the back problem is developing and it may be irreversible if we don’t do surgery pretty soon.” He elected to do the surgery, and we had to rearrange the training quite a bit to accommodate Guy’s surgery and his recovery, obviously.\\n\\n So, we did, and the training people did a wonderful job, and the flight directors helped out tremendously to rearrange the training so that we could essentially miss Guy for a few months while he recovered, and then cram everything in that we had to with Guy at the end. It did get real busy at the end, but they did a remarkable job of accommodating Guy’s absence within a few months of the launch.\\n\\n It worked out great. It did get busy at the end. As you near a launch date, you’ve done all your malfunction training, they’ve thrown everything at you they can, and what you’d like to do is fly a nominal mission, just to see what it was like, because you don’t want to be surprised when everything goes right and you say, “Wow, I’ve never seen that before. What do we do now?” We probably didn’t get as many nominal training flights as we would’ve normally gotten, but I think it worked out very well. Nobody balked on the ground about having to rearrange the training, they just did a wonderful job of scheduling.\\n\\n I remember it wasn’t just the training for flying the mission, it was the emergency escape stuff we had to do, bailing out and that sort of thing. A lot of that that you normally do early, we had to do late. Building 9, suiting up, the different types of emergency egress training you have to do, we had to put that off until Guy was physically able to do it, because you have to do it as a whole crew. That sort of stuff was crammed in at the end, but the crew was just fantastic about working a little longer hours, because Guy had spent years training on these payloads, and there wasn’t anybody else that could do it other than Lacy Veach, but you need two people. That took some accommodation.\\n\\n One of the strengths of NASA is the training they provide the crews. Historically it’s just as thorough and realistic as possible to get. They’re really good at that sort of thing, so, we benefited from that kind of skill."

We were able, I think, to have a lot more freshness in our malfunctions due to some of the delays, so that’s one of the side benefits of a delay, if you will."

        "utterance": "Yes, it was interesting. I think we may have been the only mission that actually had to divert to Florida. We were planning on landing at Edwards [Air Force Base, California], and my family was out there. Because I’m from Southern California I had lots of former classmates and teachers, family members, and I’ve got a brother and two sisters that live in Southern California, so they were all out there at Edwards. I think it was the winds that were the problem out there, literally a couple of minutes before deorbit, they asked us to re-target to Florida. It was one of those things you’ve got to type it in, or load it and then they check it on the ground, and then you enable it, and go, and it’s just about that fast we did it. So, none of the family were there to greet us when we landed, which was unfortunate. We got to meet them back in Houston, we flew in from both coasts.\\n\\n The neat part for me, though, was because we were coming down more or less the center of the United States and we were in a left turn to go to Florida instead of a right turn to go to California, we were in a left bank almost all the way, literally, during reentry, once you got down to the atmosphere. It was a clear day; there wasn’t a cloud in the sky throughout the whole United States, it was an absolutely clear day. Here I am looking out my window, and at 200,000 feet—remember, airliners fly at 35,000 feet—I’m looking down at this beautiful country, at the Rocky Mountains and the plains, and I can see yellow school buses on the roads way down there. I can see contrails from the airliners way down there, and I’m trying to describe this to the rest of the crew. They can’t see anything, of course; I’ve got the only window out there. I forget who after a while, said, “Oh, just shut up.”\\n\\n It was really special for me to be able to look out, and I had to keep focusing back, bringing my attention back in the cockpit to pay attention to the Orbiter. That was a really special moment for me. I don’t think we ever came out of the left turn until rolling out on final. I was so lucky to have an absolutely clear day, which was unusual, across the whole country. Wish I’d had a camera set up there to record all that."

But, it was because of all the payloads that we had, the Strategic Defense Initiative and the Air Force payloads that we were carrying, and the data we brought back. The mission was successful with all the data we brought back, and I think that’s why they decided [to give us the award.]\\n\\n It was a challenging mission, doing that. We called it the Malarkey Milkshake. John [M.] Malarkey was the guy who had designed these maneuvers in space to record the rocket engine plumes, and they were fairly complicated. We’d fire the engines and then flip around and fire them again, and flip around. So, we called it the Malarkey Milkshake. It was a complicated flight, and then of course we did the rendezvous, so it was pretty involved, and I think Av Week recognized the complexity of the flight and the fact that it was very successful in accomplishing the goals, and helped to enable the Strategic Defense Initiative development. I think it helped Mike Griffin’s career. I used to tease him about that. I said, “You may be the chief engineer of the universe, but we helped your career.”"

        "utterance": "That’s right, that’s true. When I came back, I was in a fortunate position, in that I was offered three different jobs. Bill [William B.] Lenoir, who was what we called Code M at the time—Bill [William H.] Gerstenmaier’s job now [Associate Administrator, Human Exploration and Operations (formerly known as Human Spaceflight)]—asked me to come up, he was Chief of Staff at NASA Headquarters [Washington, DC]. The Navy offered me a job to come back to the Space Command, essentially as the chief of staff with the possibility of promotion to admiral eventually. Then I had offers from industry; Loral [Corporation] had the most attractive offer for me. My daughter was about to start college, going off to Baylor [University, Waco, Texas], and I had my son about five years behind that. Both the NASA job and the Navy job would’ve meant moving to DC, which is pretty expensive back there, so I wasn’t real anxious to move to DC.\\n\\n I think either job would’ve been fascinating, and I was curious to see if I could make admiral if I went back to the Navy, because it hadn’t been done very much. Dick [Richard H.] Truly had done it, of course. Air Force tended to promote their astronauts to general more than the Navy to admiral. I think part of that is because they’d made Alan [B.] Shepard an admiral, and I don’t think the Navy was terribly happy. They expected to get more publicity and help for Alan Shepard, and he wanted to do space stuff, and they wanted him to be more visible. I think rather than give up an admiral slot to an astronaut, they wanted you to come back. Now, a couple of people have gone back, obviously, Ken [T. K.] Mattingly and Dick Truly, and made admiral.\\n\\n It was kind of tempting to see if you could make admiral, but living in DC was a big factor to me. Financially it would have been a hardship. I was very curious about the other side of the business world, what it was like in the contractor community. So, both from a financial point of view, compensation, and from a curiosity, learning how the other side worked, that was pretty interesting to me, and Loral made me a good offer. I was able to retire from the Navy after 23 years, so I can draw a Navy pension while I’m getting paid by Loral. It worked out pretty well for me. They put me in a job where obviously I had responsibility for NASA programs for Loral, and one of them was the Shuttle Training Aircraft avionics out at Ellington [Field, Houston, Texas], which was fun for me, and a few other programs.\\n\\n And then Loral bought IBM Federal Systems. I think it was the first time IBM had sold off any of their business. IBM had a contract for the Shuttle flight software, and had always had it, and suddenly I inherited that with a whole bunch of very unhappy former IBM employees who thought they’d be IBMers forever. They were shocked to find themselves suddenly working for a company called Loral they couldn’t even pronounce. Was it “lor-all” or what? So it took a lot of convincing for them to convince them the world hadn’t ended, that their jobs were important, nothing was really changed except the name on the paycheck.\\n\\n I think it worked out pretty well, and it was fun for me. It was a shock for the Loral people. This probably doesn’t have anything to do with NASA, but Bernard [L.] Schwartz, who was the CEO of Loral, had done an amazing job of building this company from a literally $7 million company when he took it over to a $7 billion company when he finally sold it to Lockheed Martin. He was very hands-on. Nobody talked to the media, nobody talked to the public without his permission. Yet he had suddenly inherited this Shuttle flight software contract, where if there was any problem with the Shuttle that was software-related, somebody had to get up in front of the media and talk to them about it. You didn’t have time to contact him in New York and say, “Do you want to talk about it?” The people that’s advising him were telling me, “He is ironclad. Nobody talks to media except him.”\\n\\n I said, “Well, we [have] a problem.”\\n\\n They said, “Well, he won’t back down.”\\n\\n It was funny, because I met with him and said, “We need to talk about the contingency if something happens during a flight.”\\n\\n He interrupted me and said, “I can’t even spell Space Shuttle.” He said, “You got it. I trust you. Do the right thing and don’t embarrass us.” Fortunately, we never had a problem, but he was wonderful about it. He said, “That’s just not my area of expertise, and you handle it. Keep me informed so I can talk to people.”\\n\\n It was really a nice transition, in hindsight, for us, and I got to learn a lot about the business. Then Lockheed bought Loral, and Bernard Schwartz said, “Look, I had no intention of selling the company that I built, but they made me an offer I couldn’t refuse.” It was a ridiculous amount of money, and in hindsight, Lockheed paid way too much, I think, for Loral. Then I find myself working for Lockheed Martin, obviously, and they transferred me then out to California to take over the civil space programs out in Sunnyvale, the old Lockheed, and then eventually transferred me to Denver [Colorado] for Advanced Space Transportation, which was where I was when Mike Griffin contacted me to see if I was interested in being Center Director down here.\\n\\n I don’t know if I told you the story. I had just told my wife 48 hours before Mike called, I had told her, “We love Denver, we love the job, we love Colorado, the kids love coming up here, we’re never going to leave. Love the house, everything’s ideal, good hair day every day, dry weather.” I’d just told her that, and then Mike called 48 hours later. I told her that, and I said, “No, no, I won’t go unless you agree.”\\n\\n She said, “Oh yes, sure.” We called that the 48-hour meltdown. She cried for about 48 hours. That was tough; there were skid marks all the way from Colorado to Houston coming back. But fortunately, when we got back, our first granddaughters, the twins, were born eight months later, and we couldn’t imagine not being here when the twins were born, so it worked out really well for us.\\n\\n As I’ve told everybody for years, it’s the greatest job in the world. Being the Center Director for the premier human space flight center in the world is a pretty neat job. You get to work with the best people in the world, and you get to see some remarkable accomplishments up close and personal. Whenever the Shuttle or the Station would have a problem, watching the team solve the problem, the engineers, the flight directors, everybody, especially from the Center Director perspective, was just a real privilege. You see the best of humanity working to solve problems, coming up with some elegant solutions to some real serious technical problems.\\n\\n Space flight, especially human space flight, is not easy. It will never be easy. And watching such a talented team work together as a team, the Shuttle Program, the Station Program, the engineering folks, all the NASA Centers work together when you have a real problem. Even NASA Headquarters works together. It was pretty enjoyable, really pretty special memory."

        "utterance": "Frankly, the hesitation was giving up a really well-paying job. The compensation was pretty healthy for a vice president at a space systems company. Anybody who was human would have to think twice about taking a pretty healthy compensation pay cut. But Center Directors are not exactly starving to death, either, and it was certainly a worthwhile trade, but you had to at least think about it before you made that decision. Coming from the contractor world back to NASA, you have to think twice about it. For one thing, I had to be careful to wall myself off from anything having to do with Lockheed Martin, and Lockheed Martin was involved in just about everything. I couldn’t participate in contract award or evaluation or things like that. Anything to do with Lockheed Martin, I was completely walled off.\\n\\n In our case, when the [President Barack] Obama administration came in, there was a lot of, as Charlie [Charles F.] Bolden put it, there was a visceral hatred on the part of this administration for George W. Bush, which you may have detected over the years. George W. Bush lived in Texas, and JSC was in Texas, so they were going to keep a close eye on JSC. I think we got a lot more help, if you will, then, and scrutiny and oversight, questioning of virtually everything we did than the other Centers did. Maybe I’m paranoid, but one of the things that, as a former contractor, they were able to constantly ask the inspector, and ask the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] to investigate, “Is he still being walled off? Are there any conflicts of interest there?” They did it more as a harassment than anything else.\\n\\n Now, it wasn’t just this administration. There was still a little bit of rivalry with [NASA] Marshall [Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama], not so much with Marshall management, but the Marshall politicians. Senator [Richard] Shelby was still very protective of Marshall and resented JSC, so he instigated an awful lot of investigations into me personally, because I was a former contractor. It was just pure harassment. Remember, this was a staunch Republican, so it was a lot of political, but it wasn’t just one party versus another, it was sometimes the old rivalry thing. That was just a nuisance and a harassment. I had the IG [Inspector General] come in and the FBI agents come in, and first thing you do is apologize and say, “We’re here again, sorry, but we’ve got to go do it.” They’d ask the same questions, and I’d give the same answers, and they’d say, “Okay, thank you, we know.” It was just pure harassment, but that’s politics.\\n\\n There was a history there, not all of which I was involved in, between JSC and Marshall, quite a bit of rivalry, and I think we’ve come an awful long ways. A lot of that, I think, was Mike Griffin and Charlie Bolden. Mike emphasized, I’m not going to put up with this kind of rivalry any more, and if you can’t get along, I’ll find somebody who will. We’re going to work together. Now, some things he couldn’t control. Senator Shelby would say, “I’ll be damned if the Space Station work is going to come through the Space Station Program, building a new rocket. It’s going to go directly to Marshall, it’s not going to come through JSC, like the Shuttle Program had.” Not much they could do about that.\\n\\n Mike emphasized, and Charlie, certainly, too, we’re going to work as a team and we’re going to meet every month someplace, as a team. Meetings rotated around the country, and there was a lot of traveling, but boy, you worked together as a team to solve your problems. That’s certainly the right attitude, and I think we’ve come a long way. There’s still some rivalry there, I think, in the mid-level managers. As a contractor at Lockheed Martin, I had a bunch of people at Marshall, so I got to know those people pretty well, and there was still resentment about JSC.\\n\\n When Mike offered me the job, I agreed to take it and then I immediately started calling some old friends, Roy [S.] Estess, who’d been Center Director, and a few other people that I trusted to give me an honest opinion about what do you think about JSC, because I’d been gone for 14 years. Usually they’d laugh and say, “Well, there’s still the problem of arrogance. JSC is the premier human spaceflight center, and they’re kind of arrogant.” But the real problem, I thought, was a “not-invented-here” attitude. They do human space flight better than anybody else, so why should they listen to anybody else?\\n\\n Now, one of the things I learned at Lockheed Martin—remember, I came to Lockheed Martin at a time when Lockheed and Martin Marietta were still trying to merge successfully. They’d bought Loral, so now we had three large companies, and there were actually 17 companies that made up Lockheed Martin at the time. I had had several years out at the old Lockheed facility in Sunnyvale, and then they transferred me to the old Martin Marietta facility in Denver, so I had seen the Martin Marietta and the Lockheed cultures, and I inherited the old RCA and GE cultures on the east coast, the Valley Forge and East Windsor satellite factories that I had responsibility for. I got to see all the different cultures, and they didn’t get along at all. They’d been rivals for 30 years, bitter rivals, didn’t trust each other, and suddenly they’re one company and they’re being told to work together, and they go, “Yeah, sure.”\\n\\n I had a bit of an advantage, I think, in that I was perceived as not only not Lockheed and not Martin Marietta, but I was a former astronaut, so I was a third party and I couldn’t be accused of, “Oh, you’re favoring Lockheed,” or, “You’re favoring Martin Marietta in this merger.” We set up a lot of internal benchmarking. We had to develop new procedures, engineering procedures, human resources procedures, everything. We did a lot of internal benchmarking to see which of these 17 companies had the best procedures to follow. Lockheed was very good engineering-wise, but they weren’t very good financially and in some of the other ways, and they declared bankruptcy twice. So, a wonderful engineering organization. If you needed to accomplish the impossible and it didn’t matter how much it cost, you went to Lockheed to do it, and they could do it, but they had no idea what it was going to cost and didn’t have a good reputation for financial management.\\n\\n Because we’d done a lot of internal benchmarking, I became a big believer in benchmarking. Let’s go out and find the people who do the best. When I came back to JSC, I was very interested in addressing the not-invented-here attitude, and you can call it arrogance or whatever. I told the staff right off the top, “Look, I want to be the best technical organization in the world. I think we are, but I want to make sure we continue being the best technical organization. I want to be the best across the board. I want to be the best human resources, the best financial management. If we’re not the best, let’s find out who is and go learn from them.”\\n\\n We have an advantage at NASA, in that we can go out and talk to companies that are anxious to talk to us. Not only companies, but other government organizations. They’re anxious to talk to us because it’s good for them to tell their boards of directors or their senior management, “Yeah, we’re working with NASA.” So, they would share stuff freely; we didn’t have to buy it. They would love to talk to us about it.\\n\\n I can give you the example of the diversity program here in a minute, but I wanted to use that name brand, the [NASA] meatball [logo], if you will, to get out and learn how we can improve what we do. Because I had worked with a lot of the other Centers as a contractor, I thought JSC actually was pretty darn good across the board. JSC sends more people to Headquarters to help out with critical functions than any other Center, and it’s because I think we have an awful lot of talent down here. It wasn’t like we had a huge problem to fix, it’s just that I wanted to open up the aperture, everybody’s aperture, and say, “Okay, maybe we can learn something. Maybe we’re the best, but we can still improve, and if we’re not the best, let’s figure out how to become the best.”\\n\\n I actually tasked each of my direct reports to go out and do some benchmarking and find out what else was out there. They were wonderful at doing that. They welcomed it as a challenge. I asked them to brief me on what they learned, and they did. Not only with NASA Centers, but with companies, and not only aerospace contractors, but other non-aerospace contractors as well. I tasked them all to read the good to great books, and figure out what a good management style was. They really, I think, did a nice job of doing that. So, benchmarking was one of the things I wanted to implement when I came back.\\n\\n Another one, of course, was the—I didn’t want to call it diversity. That’s got a bad connotation. What we elected to call it then was Inclusion and Innovation, and what I was trying to emphasize to people was, we’ve got to be more innovative. If we have this not-invented-here attitude, we’re going to have blinders on and we’re not going to see the latest innovations, and we ought to be setting the example in the space program, especially the human space program. We ought to be the most innovative in the world. If we’re going to be the most innovative, we’ve got to go find talent from every pool of talent around the country. I don’t really care if it’s black or yellow or what, I don’t care if it’s male or female, I don’t care if it’s LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender], I want talent here. I want the best. One of the things you learn as a contractor is you’re competing to survive. That was actually the big attraction for me to go to the contractor; I love to win, I love to compete, I love to win contracts and perform on contracts, because I’m a pretty competitive guy.\\n\\n But NASA is also in competition. We’re competing for the best and the brightest out there against industry. I had a huge advantage in industry, because I could pay whatever I needed to get somebody. Now, in Colorado I was competing—Colorado was the fourth largest aerospace employer, state-wise. The state of Colorado was, after California, Texas, and Florida; we were number four. Huge aerospace. Lockheed-Martin was the largest employer in the state of Colorado, except for Walmart. We had thousands of people working up there, but most of our recruiting was from the Colorado universities. There were seven engineering schools in Colorado, and I was on a first-name basis with the dean of engineering at every one of them. I would go out and meet with them and agree to come and occasionally talk to their engineering schools about flying in space, if they would clue me in on who their best and brightest students were, so I could offer them summer intern jobs and then pick and choose the best and the brightest.\\n\\n I got a lot of wonderful female engineers that way. There weren’t too many minority students in Colorado in the schools. When I came back to JSC, I wanted to emphasize, “Look, we are competitive, we have to compete for the best and the brightest. We’re competing not only with industry, who can offer more money than we can, but we’re competing with other government organizations, and we’re competing internationally, for heaven’s sake. We have to set the gold standard.”\\n\\n Now, we have a huge advantage. Young kids coming out of college love to be able to say, “I’m going to work for NASA.” We really do get the best and the brightest, we get the cream of the crop at JSC, and at NASA. But, we have to continually challenge them or they’re going to leave and go someplace else. So innovation is important. Inclusion is important, because I need to have a role model, and one of the things I learned, obviously, from the young ladies that were leaving Lockheed-Martin, was they need to see somebody up in senior management that looks like them.\\n\\n Inclusion was important. I needed to have a representative management structure. Because we had such a wealth of talent at JSC, I could make sure I had a representative management structure, and it was a very talented group of people. I paid attention to the numbers; not a quota system, but I made sure we were having a representative workforce, so that if a young engineer came in, no matter what their background was, what segment of society they belonged to, they could look up and say, “Oh, I see somebody like me up there.” And then they could talk to their compatriots, and that’s how you get the best and the brightest.\\n\\n Instead of calling it a diversity council, we called it the Inclusion and Innovation [I & I] Council and Program. The team did a wonderful job of setting that up. Remember, they’d had diversity programs before, and they weren’t very well received, I don’t think, or terribly successful. It’s funny, because we implemented our Inclusion and Innovation Council and Programs and started setting up employee resource groups, and when human resources came to suggest the idea of employee resource groups, I was very skeptical. I was the last one to sign on. They’d had affinity groups before that at JSC, and my understanding is they kind of turned into gripe sessions, if you will, and I said, “I don’t need that. If the whole idea is to be inclusive, why are we setting up separate groups that are exclusive?”\\n\\n They said, “Well, because it can work if it’s done right.”\\n\\n I said, “Okay, show me where it can work if it’s done right.” So, we started benchmarking outside JSC, and we went to Toyota motor plant and factory in Indiana, visited them for a couple of days. We went to Georgia Power in Atlanta, and visited them. Talked to several companies, several other government organizations that set up the equivalent of employee resource groups and had been successful at it. We’d have meetings where they’d explain what they were doing, and they loved to talk to NASA, it was a big deal for them.\\n\\n Toyota plant was neat because I got to drive their test track out there. People were really motivated there, which was neat too, and I’d been buying Toyota products for years, so it worked out pretty well. Then, after the briefings, I’d get one-on-one with the vice president or plant manager and say, “Okay, now tell me the problems you had and what you were worried about, and how did it work out.” And every one of them would say, “Well, I was skeptical at first.” But, if you set it up right, if you define the charter for these groups very carefully, and the charter has to be, “How are you as a group going to help us accomplish our mission?” The union will represent you on your gripe sessions. If you want more money or whatever, the union’s job is to argue for that. Your job is to figure out how you’re going to help us accomplish our mission. How are you going to recruit people like you, the best and the brightest; how are you going to make them fit in when they get here; how are you going to train them and develop them so they’re promoted quickly? In other words, how do you make them feel part of the team as early as possible, so they know from day one they have a responsibility to speak up and contribute? That’s the charter for every employee resource group. It’s not, “What more can we do for us?” It’s, “What more can we as a group do for Johnson Space Center and NASA, and the space program?”\\n\\n If that’s the charter and you review every month, how are you helping us accomplish those goals, recruiting, training? How do you make people feel immediately part of the NASA family? If you keep concentrating on that, it can be very successful. If it starts to wander off into, “Well, we don’t think we’re being treated properly,” for whatever reason, it’s going to fall apart. I think it’s still working. They’ve set up additional employee resource groups, like the women’s group. When I left, we had an African-American, and Asian, and what did we call the LGBT group? Out and Allied?"

It was somewhat ironic when the Obama administration came into office, one of the first things Lori [M.] Garver did was say, “Okay, you haven’t been doing anything on diversity, and we’re going to change that.” She came in, and I’ll be honest with you, Lori was an old friend, her husband worked for me, he was at Lockheed, and Lori was a paid consultant for us. She was heavily involved in the Democratic Party. Lori was an old friend.\\n\\n It’s not unusual to have the Deputy Administrator be a political type, political appointee; Shana [L.] Dale was a Republican under Mike [Griffin], so it wasn’t unusual to have it. Lori started to—and I think Charlie didn’t have any choice—but she wanted to get involved in the technical decisions, in the management decisions. Remember, Lori had no executive or management experience. None, zero, zip. And she had no technical background. She prided herself on not being technical, and now she’s the Deputy Administrator of NASA.\\n\\n She came in, and first thing she did was get all the Center Directors and Associate Administrators together and essentially said, “Okay, your job is to figure out how you’re going to make cuts.”\\n\\n We said, “Beg your pardon?”\\n\\n She basically said, “Your bonuses and evaluations depend on how much you cut, people in jobs and so forth.”\\n\\n We said—actually, we started laughing, which didn’t help her a whole lot. It quickly became obvious, I think, to her that we weren’t in this for the money. They can take away bonuses, they can take away our salaries; nobody was really in this for the money. We thought that NASA’s mission and the space program was pretty important to the country. We made it pretty plain to her that we expected her to help us accomplish the mission, and she made it plain that the political ends and objectives were her priority.\\n\\n It was a rough relationship right off the bat. She had heard from some of the Centers, it turned out, I think it was [NASA] Langley [Research Center, Hampton, Virginia], that they’d had some problems there, and she assumed it was problematic throughout NASA. She wanted to fix everything right off the bat, and really not much was broken, at least on the human space flight side. Because she had no management experience or executive experience, she really didn’t have much to offer to help, and she didn’t even know the right questions to ask. She just said, “Here’s the political objective. How are you going to meet it?” Her two favorite phrases were, “If you don’t agree, leave”—usually she said that when Charlie [Bolden] was out of the room—and when Charlie would come back he’d say, “I need to hear dissenting opinions,” and we’re going, “Boy, you two ought to talk occasionally.”\\n\\n Then her other favorite phrase was “How come I wasn’t aware of that?” We wanted to say, “Well, if you had a background and some experience, and you ask the right questions, you’d probably be aware of that,” whatever it is. She didn’t care for JSC or Texas, because of George W. Bush being from Texas.\\n\\n She wanted to cut us back dramatically, a number of SES [Senior Executive Service] slots, a number of personnel, much more dramatically than the other Centers. So, we had some real difficult discussions. She’d go to the White House staff, and they’d give Charlie guidance, so he was caught in the middle. Frankly, we would work with our congressmen. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, and Senator Bill Nelson were fantastic. I knew Bill, of course, when he flew on the Shuttle, and Kay Bailey was wonderful. Tom DeLay wasn’t there anymore, but Senator Hutchison did everything she could. Even Senator Barbara [A.] Mikulski was very helpful. I think they did a tremendous amount to help me protect JSC. We’d gotten big cuts, but not disproportional to the rest of NASA, which was the objective, I think. Senator Shelby made sure things went to Marshall directly and not through JSC, which was fine.\\n\\n Lori, of course, wanted to have this big diversity program, and she starts making demands, and we said, “Well, maybe you ought to learn what we already have in the way of diversity.” So, three of us volunteered; I think it was Langley, and [NASA] Goddard [Research Center, Greenbelt, Maryland]. Each of us got up and made a presentation on our diversity programs, and I think it blew her away, what we’d been doing for years, including our employee resource groups. She said, “You’re going to have employee resource groups.”\\n\\n We said, “We’ve had them for quite a while, actually.”\\n\\n Of course her response was, “How come I wasn’t aware of this?”\\n\\n We said, “Well, maybe if you’d asked.”\\n\\n My concern was that because the administration was making a big deal about diversity, that our efforts in Inclusion and Innovation would be interpreted as being responsive to this new administration, and I had to try to tell people, “Well, we had this in place long before this administration came in, and this is not a reaction to their political objectives.” I don’t know how successful that was or not. I think the employee resource groups have been successful, from everything I’ve heard. I think the Inclusion and Innovation Council is still working fine out there, and [JSC Center Director] Ellen [Ochoa] was very determined to make it successful.\\n\\n But boy, politics just drives you nuts, especially in the space program. If we think we have problems, the other government agencies have even more serious problems. I think part of it is because we’re so technical, which is so foreign to most of the political types, they will set political objectives and they’ll try to meddle, but when push comes to shove, they don’t know what the heck we’re doing and they have to leave us alone. Part of it is the Congress has said, “We’re going to buffer a little bit. We want a space exploration program, and we’re going to compromise with what the administration wants to do.”\\n\\n In a sense, you’ve got a commercial program that the administration wanted and a space exploration program that Congress wanted; neither one has been funded as much as they’d like, so like typical government, it’s a compromise. But, at least we have a space program. Not as soon as we’d like, and we’re paying the Russians a whole lot longer than I’d like to take our people back and forth to space; never dreamed we’d still be paying them at this date, but that’s the way it’s worked out."

        "utterance": "Well, it was very unique, and I look at it as almost a golden age. We had three major programs in different stages of development. The Shuttle Program, which was flying out, and the Station Program, which was in the middle of being built, still, and then you had the Constellation Program that was on the drawing boards. You had three huge human space flight programs that were in different stages in development. Man, I’m in heaven. It doesn’t get any better than this. We’re launching Shuttles, we’re doing amazing missions, we’re building the Space Station, we’re already conducting research on the Space Station, and we’re looking to the future with the Constellation Program.\\n\\n The first couple of years, it was really neat. Just wonderful. It almost correlated to when our astronaut class came in in 1978, the Shuttle Program was still on drawing boards and it was three years away from the first flight, but we knew it was coming, we’re working hard, we’re literally working around the clock to make the Shuttle fly. And the first six years we were here, it was like a dream. The perfect job, we got to fly the Shuttle on our first mission, it’s just fantastic.\\n\\n Then [Space Shuttle] Challenger [STS-51L accident] happened and it brought us back down to Earth. This is a tough business, a dangerous business. The dream faded, reality came in, and it was that way when I came back as Center Director; the first three years were just a dream. Then Obama comes in and cancels the Constellation Program, and we knew the Shuttle Program was going to come to an end as well. At the time, the Space Station was going to be up there till 2020, and that was it.\\n\\n When Obama canceled the Constellation Program, there was a period of about six weeks where I was really concerned. I don’t get depressed easily, because I have the grandkids, but I wasn’t sleeping well, because I didn’t see the future of the human space program in this country. When you think about it, the Constellation Program has been canceled, it wasn’t restructured, which was what Charlie wanted, and the Shuttle Program is going to come to an end, and the Station Program is going to come to an end shortly thereafter. There was nothing else on the drawing boards. Nothing. What’s the purpose of the Johnson Space Center? It’s the human space flight center, and we weren’t going to do human space flight.\\n\\n I spent a lot of time in DC visiting with Senator Nelson, Senator Mikulski, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Congressman John [A.] Culberson, and Frank [R.] Wolf, who was chairman of the committee. Of course met with John Cornyn as well, the other senator. He wasn’t on any of the NASA committees. I spent a lot of time with congressmen, and they were very receptive. The Texas congressional delegation is fairly cohesive, even the Republicans and Democrats. Remember we had Sheila Jackson Lee, who was pretty involved in the space program. They were protective about Texas and JSC and the human space program, which I think was good for us. Bill Nelson was leading the effort, and obviously Kennedy Space Center depends on a human space program as well. So, we had some real strong advocates in Congress, and I think they essentially saved the Orion [Program] and the rocket that Marshall was building.\\n\\n It was a very difficult period there for several weeks. The administration was determined that we were going to get out of the human space flight business, turn it over to the commercial operators. To do what? If the Space Station was going to come to an end, where are we going to low-Earth orbit to? What’s there? The business case for commercial operators is to take things to and from the Space Station, and we’re going to pay them a whole lot of money to do that. If the Space Station was going to end, what’s the business case? Why are we spending billions of dollars to develop commercial spacecraft that have no place to go? We’re not going to pay for them to go after the Space Station is gone. So, it didn’t make a whole lot of sense to have a commercial program when you don’t have the destination.\\n\\n We have an exploration program, the Orion Program, to go beyond low-Earth orbit because of Congress, not because of this administration, and we’re not going to get there as soon as I’d like, but I think we’re going to get there. It seems to be on pretty solid ground now, so eventually we’ll get there. So, let’s see, I ought to go look up and see what all my objections were when they came back, I had a handful here."

        "utterance": "There were several things I wanted to emphasize when I came back to JSC. One, obviously, was innovation because of all the comments I got about not invented here. I wanted JSC to be more open-minded and receptive to ideas. The Diversity Council, which we renamed Inclusion and Innovation, I wanted to set that up, and we did that. I told HR, Natalie [V.] Saiz, that I was interested in a program that we eventually called PPMD, Program Project Management Development. I think one of the toughest jobs anybody can have is a program manager, whether for government or the contractor, a large program, talking multibillion-dollar program, integrating and managing a multibillion-dollar program is really tough, especially a technical program like we have.\\n\\n I had the opportunity at Lockheed Martin to see a number of programs for DoD, for NASA, for other government agencies, and all the NASA Centers. I think I had programs at virtually, maybe 8 out of the 10 NASA Centers, so I got to see good ones and bad ones in program management, both on the contractor side and the government side. I wanted to strengthen our program manager development efforts, and especially along the lines of helping prospective program managers learn from previous programs the mistakes that had been made. I told that to Natalie, and she came up with this PPMD program that I think was pretty good.\\n\\n I was able to—because I knew an awful lot of the program managers, both on the government side and the contractor side—bring in these program managers on some big programs to talk to the students. We had people from all around NASA in these PPMD classes, all the NASA Centers participated. I wanted them to hear the mistakes that had been made, the lessons learned, so maybe they wouldn’t have to reinvent the wheel and make the same mistakes.\\n\\n It was an expensive program, bringing people in, and I think because of budget reasons we had to stop it eventually after three classes. But, I got rave reviews from all the people that participated in these programs. I learned a lot listening to the program managers. Jeff [Jeffrey W.] Bantle, who had been a flight director here at NASA went off and was a program manager for the presidential helicopter program, which was [problematic] for a lot of reasons, and listening to Jeff talk about it, boy did I learn a lot.\\n\\n I also believe that NASA had a lot better program managers than DoD, in general. DoD has a big advantage in that they can classify a program, make it classified, and then they can just throw money at any problem. I had a lot of DoD classified programs, and if you said, “Oh, we’ve got a problem with,” they’d say, “Fine, how much does it cost to fix it?” and you’d go fix it. We don’t have that advantage with NASA, because everything’s out in the open, every dollar is scrutinized.\\n\\n I wanted a PPMD program, and I think we did that for a while. I wanted a diversity program. I wanted to strengthen the business planning PP&C, Program Planning and Control, how we track our funds. I don’t know if you remember, Dan [Daniel S.] Goldin once had to testify in front of Congress about the Space Station, and he testified during the summer and said, “We’re fine, doing fine.” Three months later he testified, “Well, we’ve got a $5 billion problem.” Boy, I was working for Lockheed at the time, and believe me, we spent a lot of time in Congress, and Congress was furious. Goldin had lost all credibility. They didn’t want to see him anymore. You don’t tell everybody everything’s fine, then three months later, well, except for $5 billion.\\n\\n Obviously the Program Planning and Control, the business management as we call it in industry, was not very good in that case. I think Tommy [W.] Holloway came in and did a fantastic job. He essentially said, “We’re going to be honest and tell them what it’s costing, and get the money to fix it and do it right.” …\\n\\n I wanted to strengthen public awareness of the benefits of the human space program. I don’t think NASA does a good enough job of informing the public of the benefits of the space program. We can’t even agree, and we had many, many sessions with the senior management team, what are the benefits of the space program. It turns out there’s a long, long list, and you can’t tell everybody everything at one time, and how do you prioritize what your top two or three things are?\\n\\n When I came back, I told Mike Griffin I wanted to emphasize public awareness, and he said, “Good luck with that.” Now Mike, you’ve got to remember, was the chief engineer of the universe, he wrote the textbook, literally, on spacecraft design. He loves that stuff. He’s brilliant, absolutely brilliant, technically sharp as they come. He’s a very good manager as well. He jokes that he’s not a good people [person], but he’s a fantastic manager. He doesn’t like the salesmanship part of the job, making the public aware of the benefits of the space program. He almost feels, and these are my words, not his, that the public ought to understand that space is worth it.\\n\\n I said no, you’ve got to inform them. First of all, the public doesn’t really know what we’re doing, you’ve got to educate them, and then convince them of the benefits of the space program, which starts with Congress. You’ve got to go in and tell the congressmen, “Here’s what the benefits are.” Nowadays, the congressmen, first thing they want to hear is, “How many jobs in my district or my state?” You’d better have an answer, and if you have an answer—and it doesn’t have to be that many—but if you say, “Yeah, we’ve got a couple of hundred people working such-and-such,”——you’ve got their full attention and their full support. They got skin in the game, and that’s what they think, “Okay, how many jobs in my district?”\\n\\n Public awareness is something I wanted to emphasize, and Mike essentially said, “Yeah, okay, have at it.” But, it’s not his priority and it’s not his first interest. He doesn’t enjoy talking to the media especially. He can get impatient. The famous saying is when one of the reporters asked something repeatedly, and Mike finally said, “Look, I can explain it to you again, but I can’t understand it for you.” That was at a press conference. I’ve thought that many times but I’ve never had the courage to say it publicly. Because it is a pretty technical business, a complicated business that we do, and it’s hard to describe it to the layman in simple terms, the difficulties we deal with.\\n\\n I’ve often said engineers tend to downplay—when we have a serious problem, we tend to downplay it. So, how are we going to fix it? Now, we’re trained to know we’re going to fix it, failure is not an option type thing, but maybe if we didn’t downplay it so much and we got a few more headlines about it, we were a little more open as to the risks, the downside if we don’t fix it, there’d be more publicity, more public awareness. It was a tough sell on my part to do that, because we want to say we’re going to solve that problem and we’re proud of ourselves when we do it, but the public isn’t especially interested in hearing how you solved the problem. As soon as you say the problem’s been solved, they say, “Okay, fine, I’ll go on to the next thing.” But if you say, “This is serious, we may have to abandon the Space Station if we don’t solve this problem,” they go, okay, this is pretty serious.” Now you’ve got their attention. We’re not very good at grabbing the public’s attention nowadays.\\n\\n I think we’ve done a whole lot better with social media now. The astronauts have gotten involved, they do all kinds of things now with the social media from the Space Station when they’re on orbit, and they’ve really stepped up taking advantage of that. John Culberson, Congressman Culberson, who literally used to watch the NASA channel in his office—he’s a lawyer by background, but he loves the technical stuff. His staff said he honestly sits there and watches NASA Select [TV channel], and he would constantly berate me, “How come the programming’s not better on the NASA channel?” I’d go, “Okay, we’re working on it.” So, public awareness is something that we probably didn’t do—it was one of my goals that we weren’t very successful at, as successful as I wanted to be.\\n\\n Knowledge management, I was very anxious to capture the first 50 years of human space flight. An awful lot of the knowledge was retiring and walking out the door. That’s one reason you’re doing what you’re doing here, let’s try to capture that knowledge. I learned a long time ago it’s very expensive, and sometimes painfully expensive, to lots of people to reinvent the wheel, to make [the same] mistake that somebody else did. We had the Apollo [1] fire; wouldn’t it have been nice to know that the Russians had had a similar fire and lost a crew several years before that? Maybe we would’ve learned a lesson from that, but we didn’t share. There’s lots of examples about that. “Oh, man, if I’d only known that somebody else did this, I wouldn’t have made that mistake again.” So knowledge management, knowledge capture is something that is very important. As I’ve told people many times, we’re here to make history, but we also need to capture our history and be proud of it. We tried to do that. I tasked Jeanie Engle to work on that, and I think she did a pretty good job of it.\\n\\n I wanted a better blueprint for the future, where do we go. I think we had a pretty good blueprint. The Constellation Program, while it was expensive, space is not cheap, and I think it was a reasonable program. Unfortunately, the [George W.] Bush administration, as soon as he announced it and laid it out, including the budget, OMB [Office of Management and Budget] immediately started cutting the budget. And when the Obama administration came in and gave them a golden reason to say the money’s not there, the budget’s not there, we’ll cancel the program, can’t afford it. Would’ve been nice to have better support from President Bush, second President Bush. Maybe we would’ve had better luck with President Obama if we’d had more support from OMB.\\n\\n I think we had a good blueprint, I think our international partners really bought in to that blueprint, the Constellation Program. I’ve seen an awful lot of frustration on their part that they expect the United States to provide the leadership in space, and they’re happy to contribute if they want to be a part of it, but we’re not providing the leadership any more that they expect, and I worry that they’re going to turn elsewhere, either to the Russians or the Chinese, for that leadership in space.\\n\\n One of the benefits of the space program is it brings countries together, gives us something to talk about. Even with the Russians now, we have no problem talking cosmonaut to astronaut and engineer to engineer and scientist to scientist—politicians have problems—but it gives us a common ground to communicate. That’s important. I’d like to do the same thing with the Chinese. I think eventually we will. Those were the things that I was interested in emphasizing when I came back to NASA."

        "utterance": "No. In fact, I wanted to do the opposite. I’d been a contractor for a while. Not only did I have a history at JSC, but I’d been a contractor working with the Centers, and I believed that JSC had a very, very strong staff, senior staff. I think Beak [Jefferson D. Howell] did a terrific job. He provided leadership at a very difficult time, and I think … he was a [terrific] leadership model at a time when NASA and JSC needed strong leaders, and he did a wonderful job.\\n\\n I knew much of the staff already, obviously, personally, and I was convinced that it was a very strong staff, so I didn’t want to make a lot of changes. Beak’s secretary was Lisa [A.] Navy, and one of the things Beak told me as we were having a lot of discussions, he said, “You ought to keep Lisa as your secretary. She’s fantastic.”\\n\\n I go, “Let’s see, I was in the Navy for 23 years, and [her name is] Lisa Navy. I think we can work that out, sure.” And, she was fantastic. I wanted to keep the staff, and I don’t think we had a whole lot of turnover. I eventually had to make a few changes, that was pretty common, I think. But, I pretty much kept the staff in place, and I tried to reassure them. It was funny, because I had a wonderful HR organization at Lockheed-Martin in Denver, very strong, and I’d had some companies where HR was not very strong. I came back here, and Natalie Saiz really is a first-rate HR manager, very innovative. She told me later, after we got to know each other better, she said, “I was kind of leery when you first came in, because you didn’t have too many expressions. We’d be briefing you, and you had an absolutely straight face. So we couldn’t read you.”\\n\\n I said, “Well, that’s strange, because my history is what you see is what you get. Every fitness report I ever had in the Navy basically said that. No hidden agenda, what you see is what you get.” I finally figured out, because my hearing is not very good after so many years of flying jet airplanes—I have to listen very carefully when people are talking. I have to concentrate on what they’re saying or I’m going to miss it, especially if there’s any background noise whatsoever. I think that concentration bothered people. I was listening intently, not showing any reaction. I had to laugh at that. I said, “No, what you see is what you get. I don’t have any secret agenda anywhere.”\\n\\n I had a really strong staff and I stepped into a wonderful situation. Beak had made some changes, some difficult changes before I came in that he could’ve put off and dumped on me, and he didn’t do that, he made the decisions. I really stepped into a good situation, and I knew it and I appreciated it. I don’t believe in making change just for the sake of change. Some people believe that. Dan Goldin believed that he needed to stir the pot and constantly shake things up, and I believe stability is important to people. If you’re going to make a change, make sure it makes sense to people, and explain it to people why you’re making the change. Get their buy-in and support, and it’ll be so much easier. But, just to shake things up for the sake of shaking things up doesn’t make any sense to me, never has. I think I pretty well kept things in place when I came in.\\n\\n I wanted to implement some of my programs, my ideas, and I wanted to do it such that I would say, “Here’s what I’d like to do. Why don’t you give me some ideas on how we can implement this?” Make it their ideas. Natalie did a wonderful job with all these things, the PPMD, the Diversity Council, which became the I & I Council. Just fantastic. Jeanie Engle was doing a great job with the knowledge capture.\\n\\n I also learned the hard way not to micromanage things. In 2004 I had a heart attack that almost killed me, and should’ve killed me. If I hadn’t been at home a mile from a brand-new hospital that had been open three months, I wouldn’t have made it. The doctor finally explained to me, “Well, you know, you’ve been working 18-hour days for several years, and maybe you ought to cut that back a little bit.” I took that to heart and said, “Okay, I’m going to put good people in place, or keep people that are good in place and let them do their jobs, and I’ll try to keep my fingers out of things and not micromanage.”\\n\\n It’s real easy to do, because it’s interesting, I love it. I love the job. You even have to be careful about the questions you ask, because you don’t want to appear to be meddling. “Why’d you do it that way?” I had to learn to provide high-level guidance and then inquire about how things are going, and then just nudge them to explain more and more, without appearing to micromanage too much. Most of the astronaut office are the type of personalities, the control freak thing, I want to make things happen, I want to get involved, and you can overdo that if you’re not careful.\\n\\n One of the secrets of being a successful executive is to find good people, and not be afraid or hesitant, if you have somebody that’s not working out, to put somebody else in. People can do a great job over here, but they’d be horrible in a job over here. Mixing and matching people and jobs is very, very important. Having a good management team in place that works as a team takes a lot of work and a lot of thought, and it shows. When you have somebody that doesn’t have the background or the experience or the education in a senior management position, it almost never ends well. So, picking people for jobs is very, very important. You make mistakes. Somebody can look great on paper, they can interview great, and in the real world they’re not very good at what they do. Then you’ve got to have the courage to make a change, and I had to do that a few times. That’s really hard, that’s the toughest part of being a manager, is to make a change, tell somebody they’re not cutting it.\\n\\n I’ll tell you a story. When I selected Ellen Ochoa to be the Deputy Center Director she was Director of Flight Crew Operations [FCOD], and I wanted her to be the deputy, and she didn’t really want to be the deputy, she loved being Director of Flight Crew Operations. I finally had to explain to her, “Well, I mis-phrased it the first time. I meant to tell you, not ask you.” I think it worked out okay for her eventually, but then I had to replace a new Director of Flight Crew Operations. Janet [L.] Kavandi had been the deputy and was a good choice, but I [wanted to be sure she could be forceful when necessary]. Sometimes you have to make some tough decisions, especially as Director of Flight Crew Operations, about when to ground people, and we had a number of pilots at Ellington that were getting up in years. It’s hard to admit that you’re not the aviator you used to be. I can tell my flying skills were not as good at 45 as they’d been at 25. Experience counts for a lot, but your skills tend to deteriorate. We had people that were 65 still flying out there. We really didn’t have a limit on it at the time; we had to put a limit on it.\\n\\n I told Janet, “Look, sometimes it’s tough to tell somebody they’re going to be taken out of the cockpit, but you have to do it.” … She did a fantastic job at FCOD, and now she’s Deputy Center Director at Glenn Research Center [Cleveland, Ohio]. I just got an e-mail from her yesterday; she’s going to bring her senior staff down to JSC for a retreat in September and wanted me to talk to them. I said, “Okay, I’ll talk about the Cleveland Cavaliers and how LeBron James almost did it.”"

        "utterance": "Well, I was very impressed. Beak and Bob [Robert D.] Cabana had set up that joint leadership team after [Space Shuttle] Columbia [STS-107 accident], and it was a fantastic idea. The big advantage was the communication. We got together on a regular basis. They had their objectives and goals, which we addressed, but the real advantage was just the communication. We could get together and discuss things as a management team. I could communicate some of my decisions and the rationale behind them, what NASA was trying to do, why we were doing what we were doing. I could say, “Look, we’re faced with budget cuts. I know it’s going to be hard on everybody. It impacts an awful lot of things when your budget gets cut, and ours got cut fairly dramatically. Here’s the impact it’s going to be. If you’ve got any ideas, we’re anxious to hear them. I want to share the pain equally.” We’ve got to be fair. We’ve got to follow all the rules. It just helps to communicate with people and having a forum to share ideas.\\n\\n That was the big advantage, I think. We had a couple of retreats where we’d get together for a day or two and talk about things, and just keeping the lines of communication open. It takes a team, contractors and government personnel, working very closely together. It’s not that easy to communicate. It’s never easy to communicate, you have to work at it very hard. You have to create opportunities to talk to each other and listen to each other, and listening is perhaps the hardest thing of all to do. I mean really listening, “What are they trying to tell me?” They’ll have concerns that would never dawn on me.\\n\\n One silly example is when Loral bought IBM Federal Systems, and we had the big beautiful IBM building out there, and I sat down to talk to these people and I thought that their big concern would be their benefits or pay or whatever. Their biggest concern was the number of parking places. “We have 22 handicap parking places set aside. Why 22?” I’m going, “What? That’s the biggest concern this group has, is the parking places and the parking garage? For heaven’s sake, you’ve got a parking garage. What do you care about parking places?”\\n\\n It was silly. Literally two whole rows were taken up with handicap places that nobody ever parked at. We had two handicapped employees. [It seemed trivial, but it was a big complaint.] They had other concerns. The number of vacation weeks is less at Loral than it was at IBM, and I said, “Great, I’ll give you a 2 percent raise for every week [you lost]. How’s that?” They’d go, “Hey, that’s fantastic. Can we give up all the weeks?” And I said, “No, no, we can’t give up all the weeks.” [Seemed like a good solution]."

I was very impressed.\\n\\n There was one flight, and after all the launches I’m getting them mixed up now, but Ellen Ochoa, near as I could tell, Ellen’s the only person I’m aware of who single-handedly scrubbed a launch. I can’t remember all the technical details about this ice buildup problem. There was a leak problem, leak detection problem with hydrogen leaking from the umbilical going into the Shuttle from an external tank, and we’d had indications of a problem on several flights that just barely exceeded the limits. We actually stood down [for a few months] while they tried to fix the problem, and it wasn’t clear exactly what the problem was, so they were tinkering with what to fix.\\n\\n We had an awful lot of meetings that Ellen was involved in as FCOD at the time. We finally agreed, the consensus was, “Okay, here’s the flight rule. If the leak is above a certain rate, we’re going to scrub.” We came down to launch and the leak was just barely above the limit we’d agreed on, it was toggling in and out of the limit, which was sort of an arbitrary limit, but everybody was go for launch, except Ellen. She said, “No, I’m not go.” She said, “We agreed that if it was above a certain limit we weren’t going to go, and I’m not comfortable waiving that.” We occasionally waived a rule, depending on the conditions, if it made sense and everybody agreed it was safe. Ellen said, “No, we agreed. It’s probably safe, but we agreed to this and I’m not comfortable.” Both Bryan O’Connor and Mike Griffin stood up at the same time in management row and said, “[if] Ellen [isn’t a go, we’re not going].” I thought, that’s the way this team ought to work. And nobody disagreed. Nobody. Nobody said, “Oh, wait a minute, let’s talk about this.” They said, “Whoops, if somebody’s not happy, we’re not going.”\\n\\n Now, that’s the kind of attitude you’ve got to have, you should have. Ellen, near as I can tell, was the only one objecting, but nobody was going to disagree. Mike could’ve overridden her easily, but he wasn’t about to do that. I think if he had tried, even—he had no desire to try—the rest of us would’ve objected en masse to it. Everybody had to be go for every launch, and it was an ironclad rule. Now, maybe that’s because of the Columbia accident, I don’t know. But, everybody was really super conservative and safe. …"

        "utterance": "I’ve told people for years, and I don’t think anybody believes me, but it’s actually tougher to watch a launch than it is to ride through a launch, and it comes down to the control freak part of it. When you’re in the Orbiter and you’ve been trained up to a peak efficiency, you’re very confident you can handle anything that can humanly be handled. The things that can’t be handled, why are you worried about it? You’re anxious not to embarrass yourself when you’re in the Orbiter and make a mistake. On the other hand, you have complete confidence in your crew and in the ground controllers and yourself, and let’s go do it. You’re just so mission focused, getting it done. You’re proud of the level of proficiency the crew has achieved in the simulators, getting ready to go. It’s almost like, “Okay, throw it at me, I can handle it.” Which is what you want them to be thinking.\\n\\n When you’re watching a launch as Center Director, you have no control, you have nothing you can do except hope everything goes okay. That’s a horrible feeling, to have no control, and because you’ve been through the training, you know all the different emergencies that could happen to you. You can’t help but be thinking about, “Okay, if we lose an engine now, what happens? If we lose an engine now, what do we do? If we lose an engine now? If we lose the hydraulic system, what happens? If we lock up an engine?” That stuff goes through your mind, and you can’t help it. You lived it, trained it, for years and years. So, it’s tougher to watch a launch than it is to ride through it, or at least it was for me.\\n\\n On the other hand, boy, you’re as happy as the crew when they come back safely. When you’re hugging the crew out there, boy, you really mean it, “It’s so good to have you back.” That’s the big difference to me. You feel responsible for the crew. The Center Director has final approval on crew assignments, and you just feel responsible for every crew when they’re up there; you want them to come back safely. That’s a big responsibility."

        "utterance": "Okay. I graduated from engineering school in 1968, and got a job working as an aerospace engineer with the Department of the Navy. I was down at the Naval Ordnance Station in Indianhead, Maryland, which is about thirty miles south of the Beltway. I was really happy to get finished with school and get out into the world. I was really getting tired of it. It was my senior year. I was not real thrilled with everything that was going on.\\n\\n I’ve always been very sort of scientifically oriented, and I figured, using my analysis of the scientific method, there were three possible reasons for my dissatisfaction, the first of which, I was just tired of school, and I was ready to go out and do something; the second of which was, I was just now learning enough to know how little I knew; and the third one was that I really didn’t like what I was doing and learning.\\n\\n So I figured the easiest way was to attack those in the order of least destruction to your lifestyle. So the first one is, you finish school and you go get a job. And so I did that, and really wasn’t—I mean, it was fine. It was a fine enough job, but a working-level or entry-level engineering job, at least the one I had, wasn’t very exciting or interesting. And so I decided, well, maybe it’s the second one.\\n\\n So I went back and got my master’s degree. About near the end of that, when I took a course—actually, which is sort of ironic—called Guidance and Controls of Aerospace Vehicles, and I had to plot out a trajectory of a spacecraft from Earth to Mars, and I realized that you needed tensor calculus. And someone who was always very good at math was finally totally, totally stumped by tensor calculus. They actually offered me a fellowship for my doctorate, and I turned it down, because I just couldn’t see myself doing that type of stuff for the rest of my life.\\n\\n Meantime, I was really getting bored at work. I mean, the job I had was very routine and I was working on little rockets, mostly for ejection seats from airplanes. They’re not very complicated, and once you get into them just a little bit, you can actually know everything there is to know on one of those rockets. One day I was just wanting something challenging, and I found myself hoping that somewhere, someplace, an airplane crashed and the escape system didn’t work, so I’d have something to investigate. And I decided that was sick. [Laughs]\\n\\n So, I wanted something that the facts kept changing and stuff like that, because I liked the learning parts. I liked the first part of a job, but you then have to go out and learn some more, and I found that when I got into something and just knew it, I wasn’t challenged any more. And so I just sort of looked around and decided that law would always keep giving me different sets of facts, and so I decided I would just take my law boards and see how I did. I did very well, and that set my course."

        "utterance": "Sure. I was looking, you know, interviewing. Since I had worked before and I was married, I wasn’t one of the ones who wanted to go out and just work in the big law firms—we used to call them law factories—and work eighty-hour weeks and all that. I guess in September of the year that I graduated, my son was born, and so I had a baby, and I didn’t want to miss the first few years of his life.\\n\\n I knew I didn’t want to work for a big law firm, and I saw that the Navy was interviewing, and so I went down. Since I had already worked for the Navy, I figured that’s something interesting. And so I went down and interviewed with that, and it turns out that this guy was litigating a big case, a contract case that arose out of the Naval Ordnance Station at Indianhead, Maryland, and, in fact, his main witness was my first boss, who was there. So we spent the entire interview talking about nothing but the technical characteristics of the Mark 48 torpedo, because I ran into that. And he was thrilled, because he didn’t understand some of the stuff which I was explaining to him, not anything to do with a lawyer, but as an engineer.\\n\\n Then he asked me back to the places—their main offices were over in Crystal City [Arlington, Virginia], and so they invited me over there and I went and saw several different offices and basically I had my pick of offices I wanted to go to, and so I ended up there. I wanted to go the litigating route, because, again, I figured I’d have new cases. You’d have to learn them, and then you’d be done with them. And so I did that. I did that for, I guess, about six years. And that was fun. That was a nice time."

        "utterance": "Yes. I went in as a brand-new lawyer out of law school, doing the smallest of small contract cases. You move up very fast in the federal government. I think that’s true in every agency. And so as soon as you show you can handle the responsibility, you can get it, and especially in something which is as solo as being a trial lawyer. If you’re a trial lawyer, you’re the one. You’re the one telling the witnesses and preparing them and writing it all and doing all that sort of stuff.\\n\\n So, yes, I started off as a regular trial attorney, and I moved up to be a sort of a more senior trial attorney. I went over for a while to work just for the General Counsel. His office was in the Pentagon, but he had another office in a different building in Crystal City, and I went to that area. That was interesting, but I didn’t like it as much as the litigation, so I went back to the litigation office, but then I was a supervisor and I was one of the assistant—what do they call it? Associate chief trial attorney, I guess.\\n\\n There were four of us. We had teams of trial attorneys working for us, and we each had a hundred cases or something assigned to the team, and you doled them out and you did the supervisory stuff. You still had your own, but not as many. It was more supervisory. And I did that for a while.\\n\\n One of the things, when I was in the General Counsel’s Office, I had worked on the implementation of a couple new laws, and one of them was the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. That’s the one that eliminated the super-grade positions, the [General Schedule (GS)] 16, 17, 18; invented the Senior Executive Service (SES), and did a whole bunch of other stuff.\\n\\n As part of that, the Navy was actually the first agency to implement the SES, and my then boss was a steering committee member. She was the Deputy General Counsel at the time, and I was working on the next-level-down team that actually put the stuff together. We worked with a whole bunch of other folks, including a guy who was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. His name was Bernie Rostker. We developed the whole thing and got it up and running and all, and then I went back to be the associate chief trial attorney.\\n\\n Rostker then—this was under President [James Earl] Carter [Jr.]—got himself appointed to be the Director of Selective Service, which was not an obvious choice because Selective Service is a military support organization. He was an economist, but he knew a lot about manpower and military manpower, so I guess that’s how he got chosen. Anyway, he called up the Deputy General Counsel and said he remembered working with me on that, thought I was good, and wanted to know if I’d be interested in this new job, which was going to be Associate Director for Policy at the Selective Service System.\\n\\n I was interested in it, because it was just about the first group—it was an SES job, and I was a [GS] 15 at the time. I think I was in one of the very first groups that made it into the SES through the Qualifications Review Boards and all that sort of stuff, who weren’t just sort of grandfathered in from 16s, 17s, and 18s before. And so I went over there for my SES."

        "utterance": "Yes. My timing in my career has always been exquisite. You’ll get more of that when we get into NASA. But I went over there and we were starting from absolutely nothing. They hadn’t done anything. The organization was way, way out of—I don’t want to say practice. It was out of date. They hadn’t done anything since the Vietnam War, to be honest. They had some things that were still hanging on. They didn’t have any real up-to-date regulations. They didn’t have anyone who would be available to form local Selective Service Boards if they were needed or anything.\\n\\n So we were supposed to spend the next few years pulling together regulations, getting something in order, and getting ready, if you had to do a registration and if you had to do a draft, how would you do it. Well, I got there, and I think within two months—and I may be wrong on the number of months, but it wasn’t many—the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, and the President initiated draft registration, like immediately, and there wasn’t a system to do it. And so we were, “Ack!” [Laughs]\\n\\n And so to say we were playing this whole thing on the fly was putting it very mildly. We had to come up with everything, including how you identify people; how you notify them; how do you send out the notices; what do they do; who has the forms. You have to get the forms through the Paperwork Reduction Act with all the registration numbers and all that. So we were doing that, and meanwhile coming up with plans to reconstitute Selective Service Boards in every county of every state in the country. And that was my job, was how to go do that.\\n\\n We put together a whole new set of regulations. We negotiated at great length with lots of different groups, from Military Reserve Officers Association-type groups that had interest on that side. We dealt with the conscientious objector groups, with the Mennonites, who were very active in that. And we came up with a set of regulations that outlined very clearly what somebody’s administrative due process would be, and what you had to prove in order to show you were a conscientious objector and what that meant, and all this kind of stuff.\\n\\n We put those things out, and we went through a selection process where we selected people as standby board members. While we were doing that, we took the regulations we had written and we had to make up a training program for them, and we made that into training materials and a movie. Actually, if you ever find a copy of the movie, I am listed as the producer. [Laughs] I have a copy someplace. And I also have a copy of the training program and the regs [regulations] we put together.\\n\\n But just as this was all coming into being—huge. We did this whole thing in like eighteen months. And just at that time, Jimmy Carter lost to Ronald Reagan, and they replaced the liberal—I think that’s the only way to say it—liberal economist as the head, with an active duty major general who had a slightly different view of what policy should be. And so Selective Service ran a one-person RIF [Reduction in Force], and I was RIF’d out of the Selective Service system.\\n\\n I designed that whole program of how we did that, entirely from scratch, with PERT [Program Evaluation and Review Technique] charts and all that stuff, and we got it done. We selected ten thousand people for boards. We trained them. We did it all in eighteen months, and we ended up with the most ethnically, sexually diverse sets of boards that ever existed in the history of the United States. And I was pretty proud of that. You know? But it did get me fired. [Laughs] So, whatever.\\n\\n Turns out it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Back then—I don’t actually even know what the rules are now. Back then, if you were RIF’d out of the Senior Executive Service, first they give you this letter, which is really humbling. It starts out with, “You have been declared surplus.” It’s a real touchy-feely kind of thing. But they gave you 120 days—so, four months—to find another job. You had priority consideration for SES vacancies in other agencies for which you were qualified.\\n\\n Now, as anyone who’s ever been in the federal personnel system understands, there are rules, and there are rules, the way they’re applied and the ways they’re written, and they don’t always hook right together. Basically, it was supposed to be that you were entitled to a job for which you were qualified, if it was there. What it actually meant is, if there was a job for which you were apparently qualified, and they didn’t want to give it to you, they had to get the agency head to sign a letter saying why you weren’t qualified. That’s not as hard as it sounds, it turns out. [Laughs]\\n\\n And I talked to a couple—there were a couple of jobs. There was one at Department of Energy, I think, and one at [Department of] Justice that I probably could have done. I’m not sure. But then when I was looking around, I saw a vacancy announcement for the Chief Counsel at [NASA] Goddard Space Flight Center [Greenbelt, Maryland], and I thought that sounded really cool. So without going through the OPM [Office of Personnel Management] system at all, I just applied for that job, and I wrote in and that sort of stuff. I did mention, but OPM was also working on that one. I had pointed it out to them and they said, “Oh, yeah, that sounds good, because it’s contracts and it’s all that kind of stuff that you were doing with Navy before,” and that sort of stuff.\\n\\n So I ended up getting an interview. First interview was with [John E.] Jack O’Brien, who was then the Deputy General Counsel to [S.] Neil Hosenball. Jack and I hit it off really very fast. Turns out we have an awful lot in common. We both grew up fairly close together in Upstate New York. He was in Newburgh, New York, and I was just outside of Kingston, New York, which are two exits apart on the New York State Thruway.\\n\\n He had worked for Navy. He had worked with this woman, Pat Servo [phonetic], who was the Deputy General Counsel who I was working with there. So he knew her very well, because they had worked together, and so he talked to her, because she was obviously going to be one of my references, and got a good report from that. And so he thought that this looked like a pretty good fit.\\n\\n Then I interviewed with Neil Hosenball. That was a fairly brief interview, to be honest. That wasn’t a real long one, but that went real well. I didn’t know Neil, but he had heard all the other stuff.\\n\\n And then I got a call one day. I had hurt my knee playing basketball, and I was in one of those removable things, which is like a cast that you sort of wrap around with Velcro. I was sitting around. It was a Sunday afternoon, and I got a phone call at home, and it was, “Hi. This is [Dr.] Noel [W.] Hinners. I’m the Director of the Goddard Space Flight Center. I hear you’re applying for the job as my lawyer, and I’d like to talk to you about it.”\\n\\n And my first reaction was, “Damn. This guy’s working on Sunday afternoon.” [Laughs] I was not.\\n\\n So we had a very nice conversation. And I went in, I don’t know if it was the next day, or certainly that week. It might have been just next day; might have been Monday. And I with my little cast on my leg, going in. Noel and I got along famously. I think I was his first senior direct-report hire when he was just coming into Goddard. And it worked out really well."

        "utterance": "No. No, the Chief Counsel at the Centers—this was different than in the Navy, and so I was a little surprised about this when I saw it. But the Chief Counsel at the Centers report directly to the Center Directors. At the same time, they were functionally responsible for the legal stuff to the General Counsel at Headquarters. So they’re two-hatted. That’s not really different from a lot of other jobs. It’s just that in the legal area, there are a few more strictures that you have to have because of just the thing of practicing law and needing licenses to do that, and that kind of stuff.\\n\\n But you still had to make both sides happy. You can’t make the General Counsel at Headquarters just really, really happy, because the Center Director is your client. You’re trying to do that, but at the same time, the General Counsel can’t let the Centers go off on their own paths all the time, because you have to interpret statutes and regulations and stuff consistently, or else if someone challenges you will lose. It’s almost to a point, you almost have to think of it as, you have to have a story and stick to it. And so once you’ve figured out how you want to interpret a statute, whether it means can you do this or can’t you do this, usually it isn’t just a yes or no; it’s a, “Yes, you can do it, as long as these other things fits.” And so once you’ve decided that it’s important and you want to interpret it, or you think the best interpretation is you should do it, then you’ve got to do all those other things that go with it. And everybody has to do all those other things that go with it, and so you have to be able to disseminate that out to all the Centers, in whatever ways you choose to do it.\\n\\n But at the same time, it’s an awful lot of independence of a Chief Counsel. And as the top lawyer, there isn’t anybody there in the Center who can really tell you that you’re wrong, which I always found to be a wonderful thing. [Laughs] You know, you say, “Oh, no, you can’t do that, because the law says you can’t.” And what’s the Center Director going to do? I mean, he’s not going to, generally—or if he’s going to tell you about it, he’s not going to go and violate the law. And so as long as you can work with a lot of different diverse groups and be reasonable about it, you can really be very independent and, I think, very effective.\\n\\n Goddard was an eye-opener for me. It was the first time I was in a job like that. I had been supervisor of lawyers before and all that, but it was working with that broad of a set of issues and all, it was very eye opening. We were given all sorts of opportunities to excel.\\n\\n TDRS [Tracking and Data Relay Satellite] was the big thing at Goddard back then. I mean, they were starting to work on Hubble [Space Telescope], on the instruments, but TDRS was the big issue, and that one was going south in a hurry. There actually are echoes of what happened in the Shuttle Program in the TDRS Program, because in order to get approval for it, they had to make compromises that really weren’t good ones. One of the ones that they had to make in TDRS was it was a shared system, where it was partially owned by Western Union; at least it ended up being Western Union. It might have been somebody else in the very beginning. I think it was Western Union.\\n\\n They had the commercial band transponders on the satellite, whereas the government band ones were—and so they were building these spacecraft where the government was essentially going to be a tenant on these spacecraft, but the clauses just weren’t right, and nobody had experience with it. And right after it happened, they had to start doing—you know, the specs [specifications] kept changing. They decided they were going to use it for military purposes, too, so it had to be encrypted in much more spectacular ways than just normal commercial encryption. And all these things had to go in.\\n\\n Then there were penalties for outages, so that we were buying the services from—it ended up being SpaceCom [Systems, Inc.], who got it from Western Union. But NASA was buying the communications services. They weren’t buying the satellites. But if they didn’t provide service, they had to pay penalties. Well, after a while, some of the changes to the spacecraft, in order to meet the requirements, got to be so expensive, they realized it would be cheaper to pay the outage penalties than it would be to fix them. So there was this monumental game of chicken that was then going on, where the company said, “Well, we’re just going to launch them, and, yeah, we know they don’t work, but we’ll pay you the penalties.”\\n\\n NASA wouldn’t have gotten any services at all, after all the money that was in there, and so that wasn’t going to work. And that was ridiculous, but that’s the way the contract was written, because nobody had ever done a contract quite like that. So we had all these various claims. Even before we got to that point, there had been a whole series of claims. There had been a thing called a mini-trial before I got to NASA, and I came to NASA in [19]’82, in September of ’82.\\n\\n They had a mini-trial where they put on the case before the—I guess it was probably Associate Administrator at Headquarters. I don’t think it was the Administrator. I think it was the Associate Administrator, and the president of the company, and they reached a settlement. And that got written up a lot.\\n\\n When I got there, there was another whole series of claims that were called the Big Six at that time, and those were pretty contentious. They were worth several hundred million dollars, and a mini-trial wasn’t going to work in this one, for various and sundry reasons. But again, because we were so independent, we were able to do almost anything we want, as long as it’s legal and it doesn’t annoy anybody too much, and it works.\\n\\n So, I had a really good time. We sat down with Noel Hinners and me and the Procurement Officer and the technical people, and I basically came up with a concept of how we could do a very accelerated litigation. For something that was this big, it would normally take years and years to litigate it. We came up with something where we had a very short—we agreed that within like thirty days, we would exchange papers on a certain thing, and then each side would have another thirty days.\\n\\n We had a thing so that over about a year—it took about a year—we would exchange documents, requests, and then about a year from when we started, we would sit down in the conference room at Goddard and the lawyers from both sides would make presentations to Noel Hinners and the President/CEO of SpaceCom. And we did that. We started one morning at about nine o’clock in the morning, and we finished about four o’clock the next morning. We just went straight through. And when we finished, we had an outline of a settlement agreement that everyone initialed.\\n\\n I don’t even know, do I still have that in here? Bill Hashell [phonetic], who still is out at Goddard, was the contracting officer, and someplace in this drawer he gave me a crayon that had the signature block from that modification, and sort of wrapped around it. I still have it in here someplace. But that was probably the biggest single legal thing that happened under my watch out at Goddard, besides the regular running everything through, and that kind of regular, doing all the stuff you do at a Center; all the personnel stuff and the contract stuff and the other. But that was the biggest litigation or problem that we had while I was there. But that was fun. That was good; good time."

The question has always been, was it worth the extra money and the extra administrative stuff. So they decided to put it together, and there was a huge amount of resistance from the people on the Eastern Shore. But it happened, and it was going to happen.\\n\\n We had to figure out how to provide support for it, and initially that was a little difficult, because, again, they were far enough away—it was about a hundred miles—and the people over there just had a different culture. It was a totally different culture than at Goddard. Goddard culture is much more of a campus. They always called it the campus. They had all these Ph.D.’s who were doing science and working with this university and that university.\\n\\n The Goddard folks were much more technicians. There certainly were engineers there, too, but there were a lot of technicians. They had their own machine shops. They made things. They were doing the balloon programs and the airplane programs, and they would make their own stuff. They had model shops where they would do the stuff, and then just the old, you know, “I’m going to whip this thing up and see if it works, and if it doesn’t work I’m going to change it and do it again.” Just a different type of activity entirely, and they just didn’t mesh very well.\\n\\n From the legal point of view, they really didn’t want an awful lot of legal advice. What I ended up doing on that is, we had a lawyer who was older, been around for a long time, named John Cowan [phonetic] was his name. John just had a more laid-back view of a lot of things, and he was perfect for going down to Wallops. He could talk to the people down there, and they would relate to him.\\n\\n So he went down there once, like—I don’t think it was every week, but I think it was every other week he would go down there for a couple of days and meet with them and schmooze and sort of ingratiate himself into the system. And that worked very well, so we did that. Plus the other stuff was just trying to get the administrative systems aligned, and I really didn’t have a whole lot to do with that."

        "utterance": "Well, at Goddard it used to be—I think it’s a mistake now, but one of the things that I was always very strong about when I was there, it had already happened at Goddard, is that, I believe that the Chief Counsel has to be a direct report to the Center Director. In some Centers—back then there were still quite a few, in the early eighties—that didn’t always happen. Sometimes they reported to the person who basically ran the Center.\\n\\n At Goddard it was Bob Cooper; I guess, Cooper—no, that was later. It was—who was—I don’t remember. Bonita [A.] Cooper eventually ended up in that job, but it was like the Code 200 there. But it’s the base operations one. It’s the one that has all the buildings and all that kind of stuff. They usually have personnel under them, and the Procurement Officer under them. They put all the business-side people, the business manager, I guess.\\n\\n That deprives the Center Director, in my opinion, of a major check and balance. If the lawyer, who is the only one other than the Center Director who actually sees across all organizations, about all types of activity, from your personnel practices to your purchasing, to your—just everything; agreements, all that kind of stuff, if you have a very strong person who’s in that business management position, and that person is being told, for instance, by the Procurement Officer or the Personnel Officer that, “Here’s what I really want to do, ” but he’s being told by the lawyer, who also works for him, “I don’t think that’s a good choice, because of these reasons,” the legal opinion in the analysis gets filtered before it gets up to the Center Director, and so the Center Director never gets the full view, or you could have a situation where that happens.\\n\\n If the person just says, “Fine. You go talk to the Center Director,” and passes it all on, it can work. But that’s a lot to hope for, because this other person’s whole organization could get screwed up or interfered with in ways they don’t like to, for some silly legal reason, and you start learning who’s the Center Director in that position. And so I’ve always thought that you had to have it report directly to the Center Director, and I did, with Noel Hinners, and there was no problem.\\n\\n But once you get to that, then, back then especially, the Patent Office at Goddard was not under the Chief Counsel, which it can or cannot be, and it works both ways. As long as they can talk to each other, it doesn’t really matter. They really do different kinds of things. There’s only a little bit of overlap on contract reviews and stuff.\\n\\n But once you get into that office, we had seven or eight people, or something like that. So, organization in a group of seven or eight is not a real difficult issue, in most cases. It’s not like at Headquarters, where you have a division for contracts and a division for intellectual property, and a division for general law, and we had one, also, for commercial. But here you have seven people, and so nobody is limited to only one type of thing. Everyone’s got to be a generalist.\\n\\n Now, you had concentrations, and so you knew that if you were going to have a major Source Evaluation Board, there were one or two people who you were going to assign to it, because they were the best procurement lawyers you had. There were other people who you knew, if you had a labor law question, these are the people you were going to use, most likely. The assignments, after you figure out who’s going to do what areas, what the concentrations are, the assignments are almost routinely made by the Chief—in my case, it was by the Chief Counsel’s secretary. She’s the one who got the stuff when it came in. She knew who got that stuff. If somebody started feeling overloaded, it’s a small enough organization, they walk in, they said, “Hey, I’m too busy for this one.”\\n\\n You say, “Okay,” and then we’ll change it. And so it was collegial, but in a friendly sort of way. Everyone did not a bit of everything, but nobody did only one thing. But you had to have something, so if someone got sick, or left, or went on vacation, or something like that, that you still had coverage. So that was sort of an issue of managing one of those offices."

The spacecraft was being done by [NASA] Marshall [Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama].\\n\\n There was a fair amount of inter-center rivalry going on there, and there also was a manned versus unmanned space rivalry, that I am confident still exists. And so you’d hear things like that, about how, “Are these requirements that the Shuttle Program is now putting on?” All of a sudden they’d come up with new—according to the people I was talking to, which were the Goddard ones, they’d say all of a sudden they would get these new sets of requirements from the Shuttle Program about vibration or this or that or something, which would make them go back a long way and start requalifying and doing a whole bunch of stuff. And they just were very unhappy, from time to time, over that. But I don’t think there were any big legal things that I remember. It’s just something that I remember was a very active topic of discussion around the Center when I was there."

        "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. Yes. There’s a way of communicating. I don’t have any pure example from NASA, although I can tell you that it was absolutely true. It really helps if you can talk to technical people on their own level. You don’t have to understand it completely. You don’t have to be able to do it all. But you have to understand it.\\n\\n When I was with Navy—a classic case—I was one of the attorneys assigned to a very, very large litigation involving shipbuilding. In the late seventies there was a crisis in the United States over the shipbuilding industry back then. There were literally billions of dollars of claims, and shipbuilders were claiming they were going to go under because all these things were happening.\\n\\n There had been an earlier spate of claims, which resulted from cost overruns on ships, and so when Robert McNamara was Secretary of Defense, he decided he was going to eliminate claims or overruns by making the contracts fixed price. Well, that does prevent overruns. What it does do, though, is, you still have to build the same ships and adapt to the same things, but those overruns, instead of just being overruns, become claims. And so you end up with a lot more litigation with fixed-price contracts.\\n\\n And so we ended up—it was a terrible thing. This was the LHA [amphibious assault] ships. And with the LHAs, they had gone from nine ships down to five, and for those five, it was almost double what the original cost of the contract was going to be, if you added all those claims. And it was just unbelievable how complicated this stuff was. There was all these—besides contract clause issues and stuff, just the technical stuff.\\n\\n There were fifty-two major claim items on those ships, and I had responsibility for about a fourth of that, one of which was the system that allows ships to replenish at sea, to transfer fuel from one ship to the other, and all that sort of stuff. They have these pipes they go on and they hook together. And the contractor was claiming that the design provided by the government for this was defective.\\n\\n I went and talked to the engineer and he said, “No, it’s fine. It works fine, and they’re just bad.” And he was obviously trying to get rid of me. He had work to do, and he didn’t want to look back at bad problems, which is what people do with lawyers, especially in the government, where the government’s bottom line is not really at issue, but it is with the company. Companies’ witnesses tend to be a little sharper on that point than government ones.\\n\\n But anyway, so he said, “No. Go away.” And he gave me some cock-and-bull story as to why it’s right.\\n\\n And I said, “Excuse me.” I said, “Let me paraphrase what you’re saying.”\\n\\n I said it, and he said, “Yeah, that’s right.”\\n\\n And so I said, “Okay. So, if you have gravity and the force is here, and the weight is here, and the—.” So I drew this diagram of all the forces, and I said, “So, in other words, the contractor’s right.”\\n\\n And the guy looks at me and he says, “You’re an engineer, aren’t you?”\\n\\n And I went, “Yeah.”\\n\\n And he goes, “Damn. I’ve got to talk to you.” [Laughs] That’s a classic example of just, you know, technical people, engineers, scientists, they like dealing with other engineers and scientists, and they don’t like dealing—no one, generally, likes dealing with lawyers, especially when it’s in problem areas, because these things are things that have happened in the past. They want to get it over with. And being able to talk to them and explain a little bit to them, better, it helps. And so, yes, it was very helpful. I think that one was the most explicit example I ever saw, but there were similar things, though not quite as blatant, at NASA."

I think he called all of the chief counsel. Maybe not all of them, because some of them were nearing retirement and on their own. But I think he called about half of the chief counsel, and just asked, (A), “Who do you think would be good to be Deputy?” And, (B), “If the conclusion was you, would you want/take the job?”\\n\\n I said, “First, I’m not interested in the job. I’m still new to the agency. I’ve only been here three and half years.” Actually a little less, a little bit over three years. “And I’m having a good time out here, but I still have a lot more to learn, and so I don’t think I’m ready for that job yet.” And I told him I really thought that Susan [M.] Smith down at Marshall was the best person.

You do what the big guy doesn’t want to do, or wants you to do, and you do specific projects for him, and you tend to do more of the administrative side of the stuff, the personnel-related things, when you’re dealing with, “We’re nearing performance appraisal time,” it’s the Deputy who pulls all the stuff together and gets it up to the head of the office for whatever, and if there’s a problem, it’s generally the Deputy who pulls the stuff together first, or with other people working with him, but is in charge of that effort to keep the General Counsel out there as the ultimate decision maker. So you act sort of as a screen.\\n\\n At NASA Headquarters, there also are a whole bunch of boards and organizations and stuff, where the various deputies in the office are the designated members—Performance Evaluation Board for SES, Performance Review Board, where you go in and you check about all the Centers, and you help figure out who’s getting what bonuses and all that sort of stuff. That falls on the Deputy every year. Things having to do with equal opportunity and some of the other ones, all fall to the deputies. And so, you have to work on that kind of stuff.\\n\\n I got down there and Jack did have one thing for me which was different, and I think is one of the reasons why he wanted me there. When I first came to NASA, most of the Chief Counsel and many, if not most—it might even be most there—of the lawyers at Headquarters were all veterans of the Apollo Program, and they were nearing retirement age. There hadn’t been, just as there never seems to be, enough hiring at any time, there hadn’t been any hiring in a long time, because the budgets had been slashed after Apollo went off, and that stuff.\\n\\n So you had all these people who had been there for—I think I figured out, and I’m not going to remember the numbers correctly, but when I first got down to Headquarters, there were about, I’m going to say twenty-three or -four attorneys there, counting myself, who had three years of NASA experience, and counting me, there were someplace in excess of—you know, it was between five and six hundred years of NASA legal experience. The average was over twenty."

And it took about five or six years, but we actually did it. We actually brought in new people, very good new people, who took over the mantles, and so when those other people started to get to retire, they had a couple years’ overlap and they could move up and do that.\\n\\n One of the things at the end, one of my most significant accomplishments, and administratively I think it was that, it was coming up with the plan and then implementing it, that turned the generations of NASA counsel over, because it was not only at Headquarters; it was also all the ones at the Centers. While I was Deputy or General Counsel, and mostly while I was General Counsel, we changed every SES lawyer in the agency. So I selected them all. At the Centers it was in conjunction with the Center Directors, but I had a say in all of them. I selected all of them at Headquarters.\\n\\n When I left at the end of 2001—actually, the very beginning of 2002—there was only one lawyer left at Headquarters who was there when I got there.

        "utterance": "Let me start a little bit before that. I came down there in October. I think it was in the twenties of October. And, you know, you’re brand new, you’re looking around, you’re trying to find out who’s who and what all the letters mean and the codes and all that sort of stuff at Headquarters. So that’s the end of October.\\n\\n After that you have the month of November. Then the first week of December of [19]’85 is the first time my boss, Jack O’Brien, is leaving. He’s leaving on a foreign trip. He’s going over to Europe for a week, and so I’m going to be the Acting General Counsel for the first time since I’ve been there.\\n\\n Monday morning comes along, the first day of the first time that I’m doing that, and we have this whole set of meetings. [James M.] Jim Beggs is the Administrator. We have this whole set of meetings, and I’m going to be in the meetings with the Administrator the entire day. We start out with the management status review meetings, and then there were some other things having to do with I don’t even know what anymore. But it was, “Oh my god, I’ve never seen this much face time with the Administrator before.”\\n\\n Before the first meeting, so first thing when I get in in the morning, I get a note, “The Administrator would like to see you in his office right now.” First day, first thing in the morning.\\n\\n I’m feeling like, “Oh, my god.” You know? [Laughs] I knew I couldn’t have done anything yet.\\n\\n So I walk into the Administrator’s office. He has me sit down, and he says, “By the way, later on this morning they’re going to announce that I’m being indicted.”\\n\\n And I’m sitting there going, “Oh, god.” Quietly, I hope.\\n\\n And he says, “Then so I’m just going to need some advice on how to respond and what to do.”\\n\\n I said, “Sure.” And I said, “We’ll work with the Public Affairs Office and we’ll do what has to be done, and make the statements. An indictment isn’t a conviction.” And I’m thinking, “Oh, my god.” And that was just sort of like the thing with Afghanistan being invaded when I first got to Selective Service. That was my first day acting as General Counsel at Headquarters. So that sort of set the tone. I went crazy after that. Weird things were going on.\\n\\n There obviously were huge problems between the Reagan administration and Jim Beggs. To this day I’ve never seen anything that explained it, and I don’t understand it, but I know that the Attorney General, [Edwin] Ed Meese [III], was informed. He knew what was going on about with this indictment. The indictment, in my view as a procurement lawyer—that’s just looking at it as a pure procurement lawyer—never made any sense. The stuff they were accusing him of is, you know, it was, “Huh?” You know, it just didn’t make sense.\\n\\n After he got indicted—if a contractor gets indicted, he normally will get suspended from government contracts while this is pending. He can’t do it. Well, the Navy Department proposed suspending the Administrator from federal procurement. And I said, “Wait a minute.” I said, “Are you out of your mind? You can’t. He is serving. He’s constitutionally required to serve. You can’t suspend a government official.”\\n\\n And it was, “Well, I don’t know about that.”\\n\\n So we went back and forth and around. At that time I still knew everybody who was over at Navy, because it was not that long since I had been there. And so we went around and around and around, and finally they agreed, no, they couldn’t. And then we got that. And then things were happening. But the pressure, they kept cranking the pressure from December, I think it was like 5th or something, up on Mr. Beggs. And so just in the middle of January, he said he was going to take a leave of absence while this worked its way out.\\n\\n And then on the 28th, they attempted to launch Challenger. But they had brought in [Dr. William R.] Bill Graham from the military, and he was from the black side. Everything he had always worked on, or at least that I knew of that he worked on, had been in the super highly classified areas. I don’t even know in what, but I just know that’s what he worked on. And he was not anywhere near as—I think partially for that reason—as communicative, and you didn’t really know what he was thinking about. It was difficult dealing with him. It was hard to get to see him, and you didn’t hear much when you talked to him. You didn’t really know what he was thinking or what he wanted. But he didn’t go down to the launch because he was up working the [Capitol] Hill for something that morning, and that was a bad thing.\\n\\n I watched it from the Administrator’s—it had a conference room attached to the lunchroom in the old Headquarters building, and so we had gone up there for a fairly early lunch, and figured we’d watch the launch first and then go eat. It became pretty obvious pretty quick what happened. I mean, not exactly what happened, but the ultimate result. And so we went right back down the hall to the office, pulled out the contingency plans and all the charters for the boards and stuff that had to get put together.\\n\\n Jack O’Brien ended up flying down that day, I think with the Vice President, to Florida. So I stayed at Headquarters and handled the at-home part of this. But Bill Graham, since I wasn’t dealing with him, he just sort of went into seclusion, as far as I could tell, and he absolutely refused to name a board. They had given him the thing like that, and in the vacuum they went along and the President named the Rogers Commission.\\n\\n I still think that was a very bad thing for NASA. I think that if the Administrator had stepped up and said, “We’re going to investigate this. We have plans. We’re going to go do it,” the results could have been—they would have found the same things, I’m sure, but it would have been done in a less catastrophic fashion. But he didn’t, and the Rogers Commission came through, and it was pretty bloody, and very, very nasty and hostile.\\n\\n There was a great attempt on the part of some folks in the media and on the Hill to really find fault with individuals, and look for culpability in lots of different ways. The accusations were really, really nasty. The press was publicly talking about whether the people who launched it should be tried for manslaughter, then if not that, then negligent homicide. Anytime there was even a slight difference of opinion as to what had been said or something, it wasn’t, “Oh, that’s an interesting difference of opinion.” It was, “Well, which one of them is committing perjury?”\\n\\n I had one of the not upper-upper level, but higher-level people who had briefed the Associate Administrator, had gotten a briefing on the rings, and then had briefed the Associate Administrator on the rings, had testified that he had briefed the Associate Administrator on the rings, the O-rings. And then the Associate Administrator had testified that he hadn’t really heard about this before, and so they took the fact that one guy said he had been briefed and the other guy said he hadn’t, as perjury. That’s pretty tough stuff, you know.\\n\\n And what it turns out was it was a difference of what you mean by the term briefed. The one guy thought he had given his boss a heads-up, but he just sort of flipped through something really quickly. The other guy hadn’t gotten through everything and seen the whole stuff, so he said he hadn’t been briefed. But it got really hostile, down to the point that they were talking about they were going to issue subpoenas. And finally they insisted that this one person who said he had briefed the Associate Administrator, they insisted that he go up to be interviewed by the committee staff without counsel; couldn’t bring counsel with him. And I said no. I just refused. And I told him, “I can’t keep you from going, but don’t, because you can see what they’re doing. So anything you say, they’re going to twist it, and it’s going to come out and it’s going to get worse and worse. If they want to do that, make them do it in public. Make them do it.” And so I said no, I wouldn’t let him go up like that. I told that to the Hill.\\n\\n And they said, “Well, we’ll subpoena him when we have the hearing.”\\n\\n And I said, “Fine. Let’s have a hearing. We’ll show up at the hearing. We’ll answer the questions. But he’ll have his lawyer with him at the hearing. And you’re not going to single him out and just crucify him.” Because that’s what was going to happen. And they never subpoenaed him. I don’t think he ever even testified after that. But it was very, very ugly. It was just all these accusations day in and day out.\\n\\n Challenger was on the front page of the Washington Post for something like 186 consecutive days. Consecutive days. And there isn’t that much to any story. And so they’re always looking for something. They always have to have something spectacular to put it on the front page, and so it was day after day after day. It was really, really very tough."

        "utterance": "Well, the families all made claims, which were the only ones that were—I think the only ones that got paid in any amount, and those were handled more by Department of Justice than us. We knew what was going on, but we didn’t know the amounts, and we don’t know. But the real negotiations were done by the Aviation Torts Section over at Department of Justice, a guy by the name of Gary Allen. He’s still there. He’s looking to see if he thinks there’s going to be anything coming out of Columbia [Space Shuttle Accident].\\n\\n There also were a series of small claims that verge from just stupid; somebody claiming that a piece of something had hit their swimming pool, I think, to ones that were just bizarre. There was a guy by the name of Capallni [phonetic] who claimed that he was sailing his fishing boat up from Colombia [South America], and that it got hit by the Challenger, and it sank his boat and killed his son. He knew it was the Challenger because there were bodies floating around him, and naked torsos, and it was on and on.\\n\\n And he got to land and floated in to land, and somehow they got taken to a place on Route 95, “South of the Border.” You know that? If you go up and down Route 95, just as you get into South Carolina there’s an absolutely huge tourist trap called “South of the Border,” “Pedro says,” and everything. It’s just huge.\\n\\n And he said that he got put up in a motel there, and a big black limo filled with NASA executives came and tried to buy him off. And he was going on and on and on with this kind of stuff, just unbelievable.\\n\\n And there’s somebody who actually made a claim, and this one I just thought was in bad taste. He was a friend of one of the astronauts, and in the personal preference kits that the astronauts take stuff up, this guy had a cigarette lighter, and he made a claim for the value of the lighter. You just sit back and you say, “Okay. I’m going to be calm.” [Laughs] We denied it. It was things like that. You had a lot of that."

        "utterance": "Oh yes. Yes, there was a big one, as a matter of fact. The Challenger accident introduced everybody to the concept of the critical items lists, they’re called, which I had never heard of before. But I think fairly understandably, people tended to believe that if you had a critical items list, there actually was a list, you know, and they wanted to see what the list was. I guess they would see something like “wings,” “engine,” “cockpit.” If it falls off, you lose. Crit 1 [criticality one] was you lose mission or vehicle. And they wanted to see what the list was.\\n\\n In fact, the list, it turns out, is much more than that. They certainly have all these items, but then it’s a very detailed analysis of why the thing is Crit 1, why it would cause it, and then what has been done, technically, to keep the thing from happening, an analysis, so that people can look at it and say, “Okay, you’ve mitigated that risk as much as you can.” A lot of that information, or at least some of that information, was quite possibly still export-controlled and very sensitive technical data, I mean just in terms of you didn’t want everyone knowing how to do all some of this stuff.\\n\\n Well, we had a request for the critical items lists, and we finally decided that there wasn’t a whole lot we could do about it, because they weren’t classified. We did have the ability to release that data if we wanted to, and the Freedom of Information Act said that if you have any discretion to release something, you have to release it. But Bill Graham didn’t want to release it, and so he actually refused to comply for about probably a couple of months.\\n\\n Eventually we put a stamp on it that just said, “These documents could contain information controlled by the International Traffic and Arms Regulation, and cannot be released to any foreign individuals without receiving export licenses from the [U.S.] Department of State.” The problem is, is that’s not an effective label, because you can’t ask in a FOIA context if the person is foreign or domestic. And if, in fact, we’ve already released it to a foreign person, we’ve already exported it and it undercuts the whole argument. But that was the best we could do, and that’s what we did.\\n\\n The other one, which, actually, this one went all the way to the Supreme Court, was the New York Times wanted not the transcript of the cockpit tapes, but they wanted the actual tape. And we refused. We actually made law on this one, and I was pretty proud of this one, from a legal point of view, because it was not at all clear what the—first it wasn’t clear that if you released a transcript, there is any further interest in a tape; it just says the same thing. And second, the people who were doing the talking were all dead, and it wasn’t at all clear that there were family privacy interests that survived.\\n\\n But we decided that we were going to make them fight for that, because what I didn’t want to see, again, in the context of 186 consecutive days on the front of the Washington Post, and I told this to anyone who would sit still long enough, “You know that the first time that we release this, someone is going to match that tape up with that picture you saw of it going up and then exploding, and the families will absolutely not be able to avoid seeing that, and that’s going to make it even worse. And so if there is any case ever for a familial right to privacy for something like that, this has got to be it.” And we went all the way up to the Supreme Court, and won. So I was pleased. That was a pretty good accomplishment, I thought."

[Dr. James C.] Jim Fletcher was now the Administrator, and Jack was feeling that the Administrator really wasn’t listening very much to his lawyer, and so Jack was getting very frustrated.\\n\\n Turns out if you talk to Neil Hosenball—which I’m sure Jack did; he knew this, too—that Fletcher was like that always. He didn’t really particularly want to hear about his lawyers, and he would if he had to, but he was not forthcoming, and he wasn’t buddy-buddies. So it probably was to be expected with him as the Administrator. But Jack was very aware that his retirement date, eligibility for retirement was coming up, and he didn’t want to do anything that would screw up potential work afterwards, whatever he was going to end up doing.\\n\\n So, one thing he did do while I was Deputy, they were just coming up on the first of the selections under Space Station for what were known as the work packages back then. There were four of them. One of them went to Goddard, one Johnson, one Marshall, and one [NASA] Lewis Research Center [now Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio], at the time. Jack disqualified himself from anything having to do with those procurements, figuring that if he didn’t, he could never work on any of those, or for anybody who got one of those, if that’s what was happening later on, and those could be very long-term contracts. And so he disqualified himself from that.\\n\\n So I ended up being the Procurement Advisor. Those were also Administrator selections. That’s the last time we had Administrator selection of a contract, to my knowledge. So I ended up being the advisor to Fletcher and Dale [D.] Myers. I guess it was Dale Myers. I think it was Dale Myers back then, as we moved toward that, to selection area. And so that was interesting, because I had not done—I had done SEDs [Shipper’s Export Declaration] before, but never where you’re doing the—you’re really doing the second-level one, where it’s coming up to Headquarters, and now it’s just going up. So you’re working off of what has already happened at the Centers, and you’re making sure that it’s ready, and that was sort of interesting.\\n\\n There’s some others that I can remember weird things, but I actually don’t remember if it happened before or after I became General Counsel. There were a lot of stuff with the Reagan White House and the policy change. I don’t remember when the policy change, where they said we could no longer carry commercial payloads on the Shuttle.

But no new ones. And if you’re just starting, so you can modify it to go on an ELV [expendable launch vehicle], that’s it. You’re not flying on the Shuttle.”\\n\\n But they didn’t. They said no, no flights, period. And as a result, there were just years and years of litigation. We ended up—I mean, Hughes [Aircraft Company] alone was asking like a billion dollars or something like that in damages. That was silly. But there were three or four lawsuits. We came out very well on those lawsuits, to be honest, but I think the government ended up losing about $53 million in the long run. That was just about a year or two ago, the year or two before I left, I mean. It took that long for those cases to go through all of their appeals. But that would have been $50 million that I think you could have at least cut in half, if not made even smaller than that, or made go away.\\n\\n They didn’t like NASA at that point, and they just weren’t going to do anything that NASA wanted to do. They didn’t even want NASA really involved in the board that determined which one should and shouldn’t fly. We were just an advisor to it. It was being run out of the White House; well, Executive Office of the President. It was a very uncomfortable time."

There was GP, which was Intellectual Property Patents. And then there was GG, which was General Law, and that was basically everything else. It was agreements and contracts under GK, so your [National Aeronautics and] Space Act Agreements and stuff were there.\\n\\n We created this new one because the commercialization pulse kept getting louder and louder and louder. There had always been a fairly uneasy fit of international stuff. We were doing more and more international work, and that was also under GG, and GG really was getting so much, that they were getting overwhelmed. So we created a new organization, which is now GS, and made that International and Commercial. So we split into four from three.\\n\\n I think that was a good thing to do, because there’s slightly different sets of thought processes and life experiences you want from someone negotiating a standard government contract, to someone who’s trying to negotiate either an international agreement or a deal which is really a purely commercial deal. You just have different terms and conditions and you have to come at it from different perspectives. And so we felt it would be better to do it that way, and I think that’s worked out pretty well."

        "utterance": "I don’t think we hired more. I think it got us one extra SES person. I think we got one extra SES billet, but I don’t think we got any additional people. In fact, the size of the office had been slowly drifting downward. Back when it was in the late sixties, I think, before the NASA budget started going, I guess very early seventies, before the NASA budget started going really south, they had forty-some people in the office, and it was down to well below that by that time. So we just sort of realigned them. And then if somebody left, we might replace them with someone who had a different set of experiences, to try to fit the newer mold better. And I think that worked out fairly well.\\n\\n One of the areas we had problems in soon after I was General Counsel—I think that was when I was General Counsel; might have been—was NASA was having more and more problems dealing with both the Department of State and [U.S.] Department of Commerce on export control. So we hired somebody away from the Department of Commerce in their export area to come in, basically take a look at and figure out how to redo our export program, and that was John [F.] Hall, [Jr.], who’s still there. He moved out of the legal office to take the program on, but he came in an export control program and a template and training in that, and then when that got created, they created a new Headquarters Export Administrator and then Center Export Administrators. [Robert L.] Bob Tucker, [Jr.] went over and took that job first. John stayed as the counsel to that, and was that for a while, until Tucker moved up to another job and then John hired in, because that’s how he got his SES, by going over there. So the export stuff was also put under the Commercial and International area.\\n\\n Let me go back to what your question was. We had the four divisions. The oldest—well, probably not the oldest, but probably the most venerable—because up until me, both Neil Hosenball under even Tenney Johnson [phonetic – is this John A. Johnson?], I think, a long time before, but certainly for the prior twenty-some, twenty years, the apparent path to become General Counsel, because the General Counsel has traditionally been a career position, not a political appointee position, but the path had generally been someone as a Chief Counsel at a Center. He’d come up to be the Associate General Counsel, or sometimes they called them Assistants, in the Contracts Division, and then they would become Deputy, and then they would become General Counsel.\\n\\n That is what Neil Hosenball had been out at Lewis. He’d come in and done that. Jack O’Brien had been Chief Counsel down at [NASA] Kennedy [Space Center, Florida], and then come up to be GK. And the person who was in GK at the time was Gary Tesch, and he had gone from Headquarters, he’d gone on, he was Chief Counsel at Goddard, then he came back to be GK, and when he came to GK, I went and filled out Goddard.\\n\\n So, when I became the Deputy, to the old-timers that were still around it appeared that I had leap-frogged Gary and I had skipped a step, and Gary wasn’t given the job. And that created some tension. One of the ways I helped with that is when I became General Counsel, I made Gary Deputy, for credibility purposes as much as anything, and Gary was a good Deputy. He was fine to do that.\\n\\n But that was always sort of the focus. NASA, from the outset, was a pretty procurement-focused organization. They had a relatively small number of people, but they were going out and getting a lot of contracts with a lot of people when they were doing all this stuff by contract. So that’s really where the meat of what the legal work was doing was that and in intellectual property.\\n\\n They always had a very active patent program, which we’ve tried to make a little bit more relevant, but I’m not sure how well we succeeded. They do the patents and they do copyrights and that kind of stuff, and licenses. I would hope that if you ever have some contractors come in and you’re signing non-disclosure agreements, somebody has cleared that through the Counsel’s Office. But they work on those kinds of areas, and data rights, in GP.\\n\\n The remainder of the administrative stuff all goes to GG, and so your personnel stuff, your real estate, just about anything you can think of, ethics, all that kind of stuff, all those cats and dogs of a federal agency fall under the General Law section. I talked a little bit about the GS, which was the International and Commercial, which we created and then put in export control in there.\\n\\n It’s a workable set right now. You still have to do things. The lines between the various codes, I’m led to believe that they used to be really pretty rigid, and nowadays things are much more fluid, and things tend to cross over. While I was General Counsel they had—you may recall—the big effort for a commercial success called Dreamtime, where there were supposed to be people coming in and they were going to do a whole bunch of stuff with outreach and with photographs and archives, and they were going to do all that sort of stuff.\\n\\n That’s a totally different kind of agreement, and it covers everything. There was a lot of intellectual property stuff, patent licenses, and all that. It was a lot of contract stuff and agreement stuff. It was just purely commercial terms, making additions. We had to get into areas that we had never gotten into before, including Securities and Exchange Commission stuff.\\n\\n So we created a commercial team, which included sort of a standing member from each of those divisions, and they would go to the main team meetings and then pull in help from their own organization, as much as they needed, but to try to give some sort of a consolidated bit of advice so that someone wasn’t telling someone, “Oh, yes, it’s fine,” and then be told, “Well, this lawyer said it was fine, but that lawyer said it’s not. What the hell are you doing to me?” which is sort of what we kept hearing.\\n\\n So we worked around a lot of that to sort of get away from the concept of stovepipes. I don’t know if they’re still doing that much of that, or if that was just something we had to do for that one type of effort, because it was pretty unique and it was something—Mr. [Daniel S.] Goldin really wanted to do some commercial things.\\n\\n The problem was that so many of the people who were working on it, it seemed to me—actually, I was told—they really didn’t care what the agreement said, as long as it was commercial. And it always seemed to me that you’ve got to have a goal, something that you want to do, and then you should see how to get there. So we had a bunch of discussions over that.\\n\\n It’s always been a fairly touchy relationship between whatever the commercial organization is and the General Counsel’s Office, because the commercial people always are trying to think big and out of the box and do something. The lawyers are saying, “The law says no to that, but if you do it this exact other way, it might work.” But that puts too many fetters on some of these people.\\n\\n When Jim Rose was in Code C back then, when we had a Code C, he and I had some big arguments over what the proper role for counsel was and what they were supposed to be doing. I don’t think there’s much way to avoid that if you’re really going to have someone who’s out there doing nontraditional governmental marketing, because governments are not set up to market, and you’ve got all sorts of other restrictions in place about use of appropriated funds and use of your facilities for various and sundry-type things.\\n\\n And even allocation of intellectual property rights, when part of it is funded by the federal government, I mean, there are laws as to what happens to those rights, and you can’t just give them up because somebody says, “Well, this is commercial. I need them.” The two sides still don’t talk very well to each other."

        "utterance": "No, I don’t think so. The employee ones are pretty easy. While I was there, they did pass the revisions to the Stevenson-Wydler Act, which actually required that the federal government share royalties with inventors whose inventions get licensed and bring in royalties.\\n\\n I always thought that could be a divisive thing, but it turned out it was all right. You do have some people who are inventors and get really annoyed if the decision is made not to pursue an invention or not to license something, because they see it as money out of their pocket. But you make decisions for whatever reasons.\\n\\n Earlier, before they did that, put in that royalty-sharing thing, the patent system at NASA had really gone down a path of not really what the patent—patent is supposed to put out in public a protected version of somebody’s—it’s not just an idea. It’s more than that. It’s an idea that has actually been reduced to practice, and described in a way that anybody reasonably versed in that area could go and duplicate it and use it. But that makes people put the thing out in public so that everyone can do it, figuring that that’ll help speed the transition of technology into society, help everyone around, and what the guy gets or the gal gets for putting the invention out in public is he has a period of exclusivity, so they get money if somebody uses it.\\n\\n The federal government was never really set up, at first, to do that very well. First the inventors weren’t getting money for it, and the inventions also are pretty arcane. It sort of devolved into the Center Directors were using the patent system as sort of a parallel awards system, and so if you got a patent you automatically would get like a $500 award. This is back when $500 meant a little bit more than it might mean now, but it could mean a thousand or whatever. But it was something that you’d get and you’d have something to hang on the wall, and you do that.\\n\\n And so people were going out for inventions for things that were—I mean, it was silly to patent them and spend the money, because it costs several thousand dollars to get a patent. And if you don’t think that this is going to be used in some sort of a mass market, or if there’s no commercial potential for it, there really is no need to get a patent.\\n\\n I went nuts one time, fairly early—I think it was fairly early in my tenure as General Counsel—because I used to see all the patents when they came across, because they were done by the Centers, and the only thing I did, it was at the very end, I would sign the package that was going over for the patent. But all the staff work had been, and all the money had been spent.\\n\\n I got one—actually, it was out at JSC—and it was a patent for a Space Station to be built in lunar orbit, using expended external tanks. And I went nuts. I said, “Do you really think in the twenty-year life that this patent is going to have that there’s going to be a commercial competition to build the first Space Station in lunar orbit out of expended external tanks?” [Laughs] So we put in a requirement that there had to be a determination of commercial viability, or at least interest, before we would actually spend the money to go get a patent.\\n\\n How well that worked, I don’t know. I think it was the right thing to do. But NASA doesn’t work on a lot of things that just have immediate commercial value. I mean, a lot of the problems they’re looking at are how do you get better power out in Pluto’s orbit, you know. They’re dealing with issues where the hard parts are in weight or extremes of temperature or stuff that don’t really show up very often.\\n\\n So, we never got the level of interest in licensing that I always wanted to get. We certainly increased the number of licenses. Langley did it better than anyone else. Glenn, which is a research center you would think would have tons of interest in patents, never had really real interest in it, and does almost nothing with it. JSC does a moderate amount, and they have some decent inventions.\\n\\n But it always seemed to me that there should have been something we could have done that would have really made it better, and really gotten some tremendous interest. We did change the situation so if someone came in looking for a patent license, we also, uniformly, would agree to give them a Space Act Agreement, where they could utilize the inventors to help them understand not only how to do exactly what’s in the invention, but the know-how in the surrounding area to help speed up the way to get it into commerce.\\n\\n That worked, too, but those kind of things take the people away from the research they’re now doing, and they don’t want to do it that much anyhow. And if they do want to do it, they want to do it as an employee of a commercial company, where they can get rich. So there’s a lot of little pulls and tugs in the intellectual property area, but only in that area would I say that anything really much has happened. Other than that, it’s pretty much the same way that it’s been."

Code I is the head of the delegation and is the member to the science and technical side of that same committee.\\n\\n That committee was very vibrant—I don’t want to be too politically incorrect, but that was very vibrant and a major contributor back in the sixties when the main treaties got written up. Since the mid-seventies when it came up with the Moon Treaty, which really has never been accepted by many people at all, it became more political, and so it really hasn’t accomplished a whole heck of a lot. There have been some things, little minor steps and things like that, but the big treaties are all of sixties vintage. In many cases, NASA’s participation in those committees, or even the U.S. participation in those committees, has been more of making sure that they don’t succeed in doing something that we think would be unfortunate.\\n\\n Certainly during the cold war there was a lot of stuff going on that was politically motivated, of East versus West and all that kind of stuff. That doesn’t happen anymore, but now there’s a very strong feeling—at least there was; I haven’t been in a couple of years—of basically Third World versus the rest; the developing nations versus the established nations, and what’s the appropriate sharing of any space resources or assets or knowledge or know-how, and that.\\n\\n Some of that’s interesting, but parts of it can be really mind-numbing. Those meetings go on for weeks. It used to be there was like three weeks—was it three weeks twice a year, or once a year? Might be three weeks once a year. Now it’s down to like a week, because there wasn’t anything more to talk about. It’s just they would talk for longer times, and it tended to be in nice places, Vienna or something like that, Geneva, but it was just a terrible, terrible waste of time.\\n\\n Now I think it’s gotten to where they are working some commercial issues and they’re doing some things that are worthwhile and they need to be looked at. I was up there just last week and I was told that the Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, which just got back from a meeting—and this is a really arcane little piece. There are two different treaties. There’s the Outer Space Treaty and the Registration Committee, and both of them talk about the launching state. They use the same terms, and it always occurred to me that they really shouldn’t be. They shouldn’t mean the same thing, because the treaties had different purposes.\\n\\n So I had presented a paper several years ago, saying that it doesn’t make sense to have them mean the same thing, even though the words were identical and two units—they were done both in the sixties—because in one you were trying to assign liability broadly, we use the term, and in another one you’re trying to define sort of ownership narrowly. And so you can’t do both with the same term. And they use the same term.\\n\\n So, if in fact you want people to step up to space activity, you shouldn’t then put them in a situation where by doing that, you’re going to be exposing them to perhaps unnecessary liabilities. The State Department always said they liked the view, sort of, but they were nervous about it, and so they have never been willing to adopt it formally, although COPUOUS just did.\\n\\n There was a meeting over in Korea, they met. At least I think that’s where they did it. But I have just talked to [E. Jason] Jay Steptoe, who’s now in charge of that division, and he said that COPUOUS has now taken the position that we have been espousing, but that the Department of State has not yet done it, which I think is funny.\\n\\n I’m sure I went way beyond what you’re talking about one area, and forgot what the rest of the question was."

There clearly were going to be issues of tech transfer and—\\n\\n [INTERRUPTION]\n\nBut at the same time it was clear that the Russians have an incredible amount of capability that could be useful. So we were trying to figure out ways to do things. Sometimes, though, and it was especially right around the time of the fall of the Soviet Union, or right after, the reasons were really more in terms of—at least it seemed to me that the reasons were more, we really need to help them a little bit. We can get something for it, but we need to help them, and that’s really the primary reason.\\n\\n So, some of the things we did I don’t think we necessarily did because it was the only way it could possibly have happened, but just it seemed like the right thing to do as NASA supporting the foreign policy of the United States, which, of course, we’re supposed to do, and there’s nothing wrong with that.\\n\\n But when we were negotiating the first few contracts, it was really difficult at times. I remember George [W. S.] Abbey being up there helping Dan Goldin, and the concept was they were going to help, and they were going to get a hundred million a year for four years. It was fine. “What are they going to do?”\\n\\n He said, “We’ll negotiate it.” But the bottom line was, they were going to get a hundred million a year for four years, because that’s what they needed to support whatever needed to be supported. So you were going into some of these negotiations where the price has already been set. What hasn’t been priced is what you’re buying. And that’s a very unusual situation to be in.\\n\\n I went over a couple of times for negotiations, and the Russians were really strong negotiators. It seemed to me, especially in the beginning when they were just coming up, they would tend to get right to the point, and you’d be sure that you weren’t going to make an agreement, and then they’d make a change, which you would have agreed to days before, and you’d say, “Okay.”\\n\\n And they’d say, “Great. We have an agreement.”\\n\\n And you’d go, “What just happened here?” But it happened enough times that you knew that if you had a deadline, you were going to negotiate right to that deadline. But the chances were very strong you were going to have an agreement by the time that deadline got there. And I’ve never completely understood that. But it worked, so that was good.\\n\\n With Shuttle-Mir, I was over there with—let’s see. Brian O’Connor was there, Dan Goldin. We were negotiating, and initially it had been for like three or four flights, and that’s what Brian was thinking. As we were leaving the building, I heard Goldin turning to—I guess it was still [Yuri] Koptev then—and say, “We need this to be ten flights.”\\n\\n We were just getting in a van to go catch the airplane, and I mentioned to Brian O’Connor—at least I think it was Brian—that, “It’s amazing that it’s now ten flights.”\\n\\n And he goes, “What?” [Laughs] He didn’t know. But we came out as a ten-flight program, and certainly there were plenty of things they could do, and the extra transportation was helpful. But a lot of it got done very seat-of-the-pants and very ad hoc, and probably was a success because of that. It was a very strange set of situations, because they were just dealing on such completely different systems, especially in the beginning. The Russian system, as I understood it, they had law and you could go to jail for stuff, but they really didn’t have civil law. They didn’t have the kind of things that we have that describe whole codes. They didn’t have patent law in the same way we had, and they didn’t have a bunch of other things. They’ve been catching up to speed very quickly, and they’re making an awful lot of progress to move into that, but they didn’t have a civil code, and so when you tried to explain to them what was happening because of this, it was based on concepts that they did not have. And it was a challenge; it was a challenge."

But at the same time, they probably would have had to have gone over to Russia to sue them, and suing the Russian government in a Russian court, I don’t know. People sue the U.S. in the U.S. courts and win, so maybe you can do it against the Russians. But again, they don’t have that as something of their collective consciousness.\\n\\n We got more into that when it was Mr. [Dennis] Tito flying up on the Russian vehicle, where he was an American. He ended up having to basically agree that he wouldn’t bring suits against the United States for things that might happen to him up there on the U.S. station, because we were a little concerned about liability there, and we required that the Russians get something from him from that. But not just with each other’s astronauts flying on each other’s vehicles. Those were controlled by the international agreements that we have signed, and it’s just part of international commerce.

It was 1988, because it was signed the same day that we returned to flight.\\n\\n That was an interesting day, because we flew down for the launch, and then as soon as the launch took up [Frederick H.] Rick Hauck and his crew went on up, and as soon as they went up, we got on an airplane and we flew directly to the State Department so we could be there for the signing ceremony over at State for the Space Station agreement.\\n\\n But that was negotiated and hammered out over a couple of years of negotiations, where, to be honest, the hardest part of the negotiations was not with the international partners; it was with the various agencies of the federal government that all felt they had something to say about it. We had these working groups that were just almost at times unbelievable. There’d be [U.S. Department of] State there and [U.S. Department of] Commerce there and [U.S. Department of] Treasury there and [U.S. Department of] Defense there, and everyone, and they all had these views about what should and shouldn’t be in these agreements. The [U.S.] Department of Justice was there, and big issues over what law would apply and what criminal law would apply, what civil law would apply. It was just all these things went around and around and around.\\n\\n The second Space Station agreement, which was ten years later, in [19]’98, which added the Russians, that one built much more on the first agreement, I think. I don’t know. The Russian part of it certainly was based somewhat on the prior agreements we had with the Russians, but I don’t think the Shuttle-Mir did. What the Shuttle-Mir did is it allowed what in arms control parlance is called “confidence-building.” There were fairly small measures that once were done, the various parties knew how the other ones operated, that you could trust them to do what they said they were going to do, and this is what you were going to get out of it, and that it allowed you to move forward without thinking you were taking too big of a step.\\n\\n So, the Shuttle-Mir, I think, was very important, but I don’t think it was a real big issue into the Space Station agreement, which I think was your specific question."

        "utterance": "Sure. Let’s start with the earliest ones. The first things that were becoming commercialized were the launch vehicles, and that started very early. Even when I was still out at Goddard, they were starting to talk about phasing out the Delta Program because we were buying them that way. And one of the guys who had been a prior Delta Program Manager out at Goddard went off and tried to form a company that would sell the Deltas commercially when the government was getting out of it.\\n\\n The government was phasing out of ELVs because the Space Shuttle was going to be—it was NSTS stood for National Space Transportation System, because it was going to be the primary way for launching everything, because it was going to launch twenty-some times a year, and it was going to do all this, and it was going to be so much cheaper, and yada, yada, yada, which, of course, never happened. But meanwhile, they were phasing down the ELVs and you still had these vehicles that worked, and so then they were being moved over to see if there were any commercial markets. The problem was going to be that if people were able to get either very cheap or very highly subsidized launches on shuttles, it’s going to be hard to sell ELVs for full-market value, or the sums you can make on it. And so that was a big issue early on.\\n\\n After Challenger was lost and they changed the policy, there was a big stink in Reagan era about changing the NSTS from National Space Transportation System to NASA Space Transportation System, because this wasn’t the national one. The national one was going to be ELV-related and all that.\\n\\n The first thing we had to do was get it so that even the U.S. government could buy ELVs commercially. After they threw all of the payloads off the Shuttle, they then had to find ways to launch the NASA payloads that would have been launched on the Shuttle otherwise, and so they had to come up with a way to buy these vehicles.\\n\\n Again, because of the differences between the way commercial people buy things and the government buys things, there were some problems. For instance, if you or I were building a house, we put money down and we pay progress along the way, and then at the end we take ownership of it. The government can’t make advanced payments, generally. I mean, they’re not allowed to pay before they get value, and there’s ways of doing it and that sort of stuff. But when you’re building vehicles for the government, like they used to do with the Deltas, the money would go to them, but then the titles, all the parts would go to the government, so they’d say, “Okay. We have some security.” It’s a big issue in government buying, about having security for your money. When your commercial person goes and buys a vehicle or a launch, they just pay money upfront. They don’t get anything other than this is a big company and they have a contract and they’re going to survive on contract law, if necessary.\\n\\n So we were going out with this mixed-fleet, it was called, buy, where we were going to buy a bunch of different launches from a bunch of different vehicles. There were Deltas and there were Atlases and there were Scouts and there were some other things. It was long before Pegasus. And they wanted to direct how many to each, and it was going to be very interesting.\\n\\n There were a couple of different problems with that. One of them was the money issues of how do you pay for it in that time, and that one we solved. This is one of the things that I thought was interesting. It shows you how much things have changed, because it was so much easier. This was back seventeen, eighteen years ago.\\n\\n I had written a paper and given a talk about why the U.S. government can’t just go buy these things, why things like this advanced payments restriction really got in the way. I got on the phone a few months after that with Senate staff who were talking about it, and we were at that point still getting NASA authorization bills. So they said, “What would we do to fix it?”\\n\\n And over the phone we drafted a statute which is now Section—I think it’s 311 of the Space Act, which says that NASA can make advanced payments on ELVs and not have it be lined up directly with the progress and all this other stuff. We agreed to the language in one afternoon over the phone, and two months later it was law. I think we’ve had one authorization act in the last fifteen years, and it hasn’t been a friendly one. We don’t have that kind of relationship with Congress that we used to back then. But we were able to go do that.\\n\\n Then once we had the ability to buy the things, it was a question of, for each of the payloads there probably was more than one vehicle that could have launched it, but we wanted to make sure that each of these vehicles survived, and so we were doling out the thing. But the Competition in Contracting Act wouldn’t let you say, “I’m going to just launch this payload on this vehicle,” if this other vehicle could also do it, because they would have to be competition.\\n\\n So we put together—and I think I was pretty influential in that—a mixed-fleet strategy, which for the first time NASA used as an authority in the Competition in Contracting Act, to use, basically, the public interest, to not do anything in competition. So we bundled them all together, put together one piece of paper that I think Dick [Richard H.] Truly signed—I’m pretty sure it was Dick—that said that “We’re not launching on the Shuttle anymore. It’s in the national interest to make sure that various ways of getting transport to space are still around, so we’re dividing this up amongst them in a way to provide the maximum survivable industry.”\\n\\n They signed it. We sent it to Congress, and Congress said, “Fine.” They don’t have to say, “Fine.” They have to not do something for thirty days, and then it becomes a totally unchallengeable sole-source procurement. That was the first time NASA had ever used that C-7 exception, but that was because we were trying to address—both of those were really just trying to address the creation of the ELV industry as commercial, which it hadn’t been before that. So that was really sort of the first areas, I guess, where we were really getting into commercialization.\\n\\n TDRS I talked about briefly earlier, and how that didn’t work because they just really hadn’t thought it through as a commercial—and eventually they had to reform the contract and buy the commercial part out of it. I don’t know. Any specific commercial things you’re interested in?"

        "utterance": "Well, cross waivers came in really more of a result from the Shuttle than anything else. In the beginning, the Shuttle was being marketed as a major launch vehicle, and we were selling it against Arianne [Rocket Program]. So you had Arianne on one side and the Shuttle on the other, and we were seeing who was going to buy more.\\n\\n It turned out that one of the things that kept people from wanting to launch on a Shuttle was potential liability. If you launch on any expendable vehicle, you don’t have to worry about the vehicle because you know it’s history once you’ve launched it. So you don’t have to insure against the value of the vehicle. Also, the value of an ELV is fairly low. It’s a heck of a lot of money, but it’s not a heck of a lot of money when you compare it to the cost of the Shuttle.\\n\\n So they were afraid, initially, that if they launched on the Shuttle and something happened that caused damage to or loss of the Shuttle, that they’d be responsible for the Shuttle, which is $2 billion, and that they were going to have to buy $2 billion worth of insurance. And, France said, “Well, no, we wouldn’t want that to happen.”\\n\\n So the concept of a cross waiver came up, where we would agree that we wouldn’t claim against them if they damaged the Shuttle, and they wouldn’t—both ways. We wouldn’t claim against them if they damaged the Shuttle, and they wouldn’t claim against us if the Shuttle damaged their payload, or something happened.\\n\\n Then it became required to spread it broader, because we were putting multiple payloads in the payload bay, and they were willing to insure their own spacecraft, because they always did, but they didn’t want to have to also insure for the co-rider’s spacecraft. So it became a much bigger deal, and it had to be written up and spread in a way that it was flowed down, and it was required—but also you had to write it in a way that you’d waive all the claims, but only against the other people. Even though you’re flowing this thing down, you still have to be able to enforce your contract.\\n\\n If somebody is going to provide you with propellant, and they don’t, you have to be able to sue them even if they’re in your chain. It’s a fairly intricate piece of legal work, where you try to leave those legitimate contract claims available, but take out the tort-based claims from almost any source. So that really was the genesis of the cross waivers.\\n\\n What happened is once we started doing that in the Shuttle world, (A), we were doing most of the launches, so people were sort of used to it; and, (B), everyone started realizing that’s not a bad idea, because again, almost everybody insures their own property anyhow, except for like a Shuttle, which the government owns, and the government doesn’t buy insurance. So all the equipment is insured once, because everyone buys their own. It’s like a no-fault.\\n\\n If you didn’t have a cross waiver, then people have to start buying more insurance, and so everything gets insured two or three times, and that drains a lot of money. When you’re paying 20, 25 percent of the cost of a launch in insurance, which is what it has been, or was for a while—I guess it’s a little lower than that now—that drains a lot money that could be used for space activities. So it turns out you can really encourage people, or at least take away one of the major discouragements from people, by having cross waivers.\\n\\n So they became fairly standard, and they got put into ELV contracts. They got put into Arianne contracts. They got put in pretty much everywhere. So that was something that NASA started before I was there. I think I helped expand it, but before I was there, they started it, and I think it really did change the whole map for that type of commercial space activity."

        "utterance": "Well, indemnification is—there’s an authority that NASA has; they have two of them. The main one is under Public Local 85804, and it came out of the old War Powers Act during World War II, maybe even before World War II. But it basically said that if you’re doing something that facilitates the national defense and there’s a determination made, the government will take over any third-party liability.\\n\\n It was really meant for people who were manufacturing huge amounts of armaments and stuff like that, so if something blows up while they’re producing war materiel, they’re not going to be responsible for the damage to the local community. The government will pick it up, because it’s really because of them.\\n\\n NASA has used that authority from time to time. It does require a determination that it facilitates the national defense, though, which for NASA—we used it on the Shuttle, because the Shuttle always was dual-use. And so we were preserving something for potential military use. We used it in a bunch of different areas when there was also military interest in the system. People got used to that. And we used it also—sometimes, but not always—on expendable launch vehicles. They got used to it there, too, and they really liked it. They just said, “Oh, you can’t make us bet our business on every launch.”\\n\\n My response to that—and I testified a couple of times—was, “I don’t know why not. I think lots of businesses bet their business on everything.” I mean, every time two Boeing 747s fly over New York City, they’re betting their business. They have a $2 billion insurance policy. If those two planes collide, fall down, land, explode over a full football stadium or into a building and cause huge damages, they’ll pass that two billion very quickly, and that extra money is on Boeing. They’re betting that’s not going to happen.\\n\\n Pharmaceutical industry, every time they put out a drug, if something happens and it comes on the mass market and people get really, really, seriously damaged, and each one sues, they don’t have enough insurance to cover that. They’re betting that it’s not going to happen, and it’s not anything real different.\\n\\n Then they said, “Oh, it’s the startup nature of the business that makes it so necessary. They’re too fragile at the moment.” Okay. Well, that’s a determination. And so we got into a lot of discussions where I would generally testify against the need for indemnification for the ELV industry. They testified in support of it.\\n\\n Department of Transportation, who got the authority to license ELVs, because Jim Beggs said, “This is eventually going to be a trucking operation, and NASA shouldn’t be in the business of regulating trucks.” I think he had a point. But he said, “No, we don’t want it. This is trucks; give it to Transportation.”\\n\\n So they took it over. So they argued on behalf of the agency, and they got this thing under the Commercial Space Launch Act. The industry calls it indemnification. It’s not indemnification. Indemnification is you get a claim; it gets paid. Under 85804 it just gets paid, because it’s there, and you don’t worry about it.\\n\\n The Commercial Space Launch Act has a claims authority, which says that if it’s more money than Transportation has, they can ask Congress, and Congress can then appropriate the money. It doesn’t say they will; it says they can. So there isn’t any guarantee there either. So they’re still betting their company, but there’s a couple little pats on the back. That’s really all it is, and I discovered that people got annoyed if you pointed that out, that it was an Emperor’s New Clothes-type thing, but they really, really liked it.\\n\\n Then I argued we could do it—by then we wanted to do some new kinds of things. There also was an authority under the NASA Act that we can indemnify for people using NASA space vehicles. So we can provide indemnification for people using the Shuttle, say, and we do that for certain classes of payloads, mostly the ones that are smaller; universities and things who couldn’t afford anything anyhow. So, we do that. But we can.\\n\\n But then we started going into new areas, and when we were in the area like the X-33, when we were trying to come up the next-generation whatever, NASA wasn’t going to own that vehicle. It wasn’t going to be a NASA space vehicle. The military kept saying it had no interest in the X-33, so you couldn’t say it was facilitating the national defense. There was no use for it. So we couldn’t indemnify.\\n\\n There is an authority in the Space Act. It’s Section 205-C-13, which is a claims authority that NASA has, which I felt was just as good, if not better, than the claims authority that Department of Transportation has. So I said we could use that, which became much more controversial than I thought it was going to be. I still am convinced I was correct. We could have done it, and I think we did, once or twice. A couple of contractors bought off on that in the thing.\\n\\n But then what happened is after we got the contractors to buy off on it, then all of a sudden other parts of the federal government didn’t like it, because indemnification itself, in general, is inconsistent with our systems of law. We have a tort-based system. We believe that law is set up to believe that people are motivated by their monetary interest, and one of the reasons you make sure that products are safe, that cars are safe, that things aren’t going to go wrong, and that you’re not going to have a horribly cracked sidewalk in front of your house, or steps that people are going to fall through when they visit you, is that you know that if you do, you’re going to get sued, and you’re going to lose a lot of money.\\n\\n If you indemnify everybody, that weakens that impetus to be safe. And so there’s a lot of theoretical concerns, especially at Justice and Treasury, over anytime you go and provide indemnification, because it’s supposedly inconsistent with the general—and there is something to that. But at the same time, you have to do something. What’s it going to be? How are you going to do it? There’s various ways and you play with what you can play with. So that’s what we were trying to do.\\n\\n So we kept trying to do that, and we tried to get—and we did, in fact, get an authority which we wrote—I think I wrote a good part of it—which says that if we’re doing it for experimental aerospace vehicles, which would have allowed us to provide some indemnification for, for instance, an X-33 flight, because it’s just an experimental vehicle that is not yet a commercial flight. If it ever got to be commercial, we’d have to go over to the Commercial Space Launch Act, because they have reusables as well. But while it’s still in the NASA, we did write it up and got some indemnification authority for that purpose.\\n\\n So I think there is theoretical availability of that, but I still don’t see the need for it. I think it’s a tempest in a teapot. We’ve been launching spacecraft for I don’t know how many decades at this point now, and at least in the U.S. there’s been no third-party claims.\\n\\n There’s been some in China where they’ve blown up some villages, but that’s because they allowed the villages to be that close, or they put their things that close and they don’t move people. That’s a Chinese decision. But there really hasn’t been any third-party liability for that type of stuff. So, indemnification, whether you have it or not, it’s a mental sop. Yes, you’re betting it, but it’s a really good bet. [Laughs] You know? You’re betting a lot more every time you step out onto the street, because a lot of people don’t make it across. Nobody has not made it out of that issue, and so I really don’t understand the vehemence with which people come after that issue."

        "utterance": "All right. When they first signed the agreement in 1988, it said that people would do what they needed to, to make the laws right. The only law that needed to be changed to enable the first act, the first Space Station Agreement, to go into effect, was there was a Patents in Space Bill. There was the Patent Secrecies Act, which said that basically if somebody tells another country, or you apply for a patent in another country first, if it’s a U.S. inventor, they can’t come and then apply for a patent in the United States, because the Patent Office wants to see them first. And if you have a U.S. inventor on a space station where it’s a different module, where it was not going to be a U.S. space, there was going to be an issue as to who could patent what, or if you could patent anything. So we had to change that.\\n\\n That one went through fairly quickly. It took us a couple of years, simply because we didn’t always get a bill, and had to explain it once or twice. But it wasn’t too bad, and we got it changed so that if, in fact, an international agreement said that you could do it, it was fine. So we fixed that one. There really weren’t a whole lot of other laws that needed to be changed for Space Station.\\n\\n In terms of what you can get away with or do, basically the law is going to be whatever the country’s—whose module it is—law, what it says it is. Now, we have a provision in there about criminal law, which took us a long time to get to, but basically it says that if somebody commits a crime up on the Station, they will first turn to the person’s own country to see if they will do something about it, and if not, then the country whose law was violated has a shot. But whether you can get your hands on them or anything like that is left up in the air.\\n\\n There was a big issue in the very beginning, where the Justice Department wanted to just say that everybody had to be subject to U.S. criminal law under all circumstances, no matter what, and that just was not going to fly for all the foreign folk, and eventually it petered out. It does say that there would be a code of conduct, which was pretty hard to negotiate. That was negotiated during the late nineties, and it’s now up on the website, and you can see it.\\n\\n One of the most controversial parts of it is it gives the station commander authority to take whatever actions are necessary to ensure the safety of the vehicle and crew, and that includes arresting people. It could include, if you want to think that far out, using violence to subdue somebody. You could shoot somebody if you had a gun, which you wouldn’t have, I hope. But I mean if you had to. It’s sort of a self-defense-type thing, or self-defense of the vehicle.\\n\\n That was very, very controversial. In the beginning, the international partners were very much opposed to anything like that. But eventually they sort of got to the point of—what are you going to do? If someone’s getting ready, and you can tell that they’re getting ready to do some serious damage that’s going to punch a hole in the side of the Space Station, you’ve got to stop them. And you can’t just say, “Please.” So, it says that.\\n\\n Other than that, there are always going to be issues about intellectual property up there, and it’s simply because people have different intellectual property laws. The Russians didn’t have a developed intellectual property law, and viewed as protectable things that we would say were just public domain data. Clearly, how you do something, you have trade secrets and those should be protectable and all that, but certain things, like the appearance of a dial, is the Russians would say, “No, that’s protected. You can’t tell anybody about that. That’s protected.” And it’s not. And there’s no way we’d be able to protect it. So we had to get to things about what is and what isn’t protectable, but most of that isn’t changing things; it’s getting to an understanding with your partners.\\n\\n The big issue of patents which people talk about, isn’t real. The big issue of patent law is when you infringe something. People aren’t going to be widespread infringing things on the Space Station. There’s going to be a few people up there, at most, and they’re going to be doing an experiment here or experiment there. They’re not going to be manufacturing mass quantities of anything. They’re not going to be doing anything that has real serious IP [intellectual property ] infringement capability.\\n\\n Now, if they do something up there which then comes down to Earth, and they sell it or something, or they take some information or infringe on something, then they’re infringing it on Earth, and there already are ways to do things about that. So if somebody steals your intellectual property here and goes to Europe, there’s something you can do about it, or if they go to Russia, if the Russians have an intellectual property law, which they’re developing. And so there are terrestrial ways to enforce this kind of stuff, and the Space Station really doesn’t change that very much. What it changes is for those activities on the Station, and there just aren’t going to be that many.\\n\\n There have been always some people who want to look—they call themselves forward-thinkers. I think of them as sort of whackos. I love science fiction, but some people just take this stuff a little too seriously. So they used to have conferences which, thank God, at least I haven’t heard anymore, about Space Station and how we’re going to export the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights to the stars, and what are we going to do, but they’re looking at issues that are not going to come up until you have, say, a thriving large community on Moon. Okay?\\n\\n I used to give a talk, where I’d talk about, I am not interested in the solution to knowing whose child custody laws are going to apply if a Japanese astronaut and a Russian astronaut have a child in the U.S. module. I’m not going to worry about that. It isn’t going to happen on my watch. It isn’t going to happen on anybody in this room’s watch. Don’t worry about it.\\n\\n When we get to the point where we are actually building cities and big towns, or even towns the size of the Old West settlements, then you have to start thinking of developing a law framework that applies there. But until you do, it’s too controversial and much too problematic. You’re just guessing at what it’s going to be like and what the real problems are going to be. Wait until you know what the issue is before you come up with a solution.\\n\\n That’s been something I always have pushed, and I hate people who just decide that they’ve got to come up, and they’re going to know better and they’re going to solve every potential problem that could possibly exist, because you can’t. And I get tired thinking about it, so I refuse to do that."

It’s an “unusual stuff” catalog, and it’s for $15 or something like that, you buy yourself a couple of acres on the Moon. Same thing. It used to be—and I have no idea if it still works—it used to be if you went to www.lunarembassy.com, you could buy anything you wanted in the cosmos. They would sell it to you.\\n\\n This is related to one of those. This guy comes in, and after we landed the [Near Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) Shoemaker] Probe on Eros, we got this bill for parking. He sent us a bill for $25 for every Earth century, for parking our spacecraft on his asteroid. And I refused. I said first, why did he think it was his asteroid? And he said, “There’s nothing that prevents an individual from owning things in space.” You can take issue with that.\\n\\n I think the first letter I sent back to him, I was probably a little bit too flip and I said things a little bit too quickly, and the guy then got some law professor to write me a letter saying, “Surely you don’t believe—.” It was sort of nuts.\\n\\n But the Outer Space Treaty says that no nation can claim sovereignty over anything in space, essentially; any natural bodies, Moon, celestial bodies, and all that sort of stuff. It doesn’t talk about individuals, because back then no one thought of individuals getting to space and whatever.\\n\\n I said, “Well, fine. What court are you going to enforce this in? How do you know you own it? And then what court are you going to make me show up in, to make them pay?” And unless there’s an or what clause—I always liked that term, the or what clause—I don’t really care what you’re saying, what it is, because I don’t see an or what. If I don’t pay you, I don’t pay you. You can’t do a thing about it.\\n\\n And the same thing, you see that in a lot of stuff where there’s a requirement written down somewhere. There’s requirements everywhere. But the question is, okay, or what? Do I get fired? Do I have to pay money? Do I go to jail? Or is it just, this would be sort of nice to do if you could, and you need to be able to explain, at least a little, why you didn’t do it. I said it makes a difference as to how you treat that requirement. And so, I always look for the or what clause. There was no or what clause here.\\n\\n You can claim whatever you want. You have absolutely no right to doing that. You get rights because—to be honest, the only reason you have a right to anything, that I have a right to be sitting here, is because the government here, over the last two hundred and some-odd years has said, “This is how our property rights are going to be, and if you get this kind of deed and this kind of piece of paper, you have a right and it’s enforceable.” That’s what makes you right.\\n\\n You have the [U.S.] Constitution that gives you certain rights. Other than that, it’s chaos. It’s anarchy. And that’s what you have out there in space, but since nobody can get there, who cares? Once you get to the point where there are a lot of people there, they’re going to have to do something about that to keep people from just going and pushing people off the asteroid and taking it on their own. But we don’t do that yet, and this guy has no claim. So it was just silly."

        "utterance": "Before I got the General Counsel’s job, I had never been in a single position for more than about three and a half years. I always moved to a different job or did something different. As I said from the beginning, I always wanted to do different things. After thirteen-plus years as General Counsel, I knew I could do that job. Most of the issues—not all; things change from day to day, and different Congresses and all this sort of stuff, but most of the issues either had come up before or were similar.\\n\\n I was tired. Ten years of working directly for Dan Goldin was tiring. And I realized one morning that the day I crossed over my retirement eligibility, I was essentially taking a 50 percent pay cut, because they were going to pay me half for not working, so they were only paying me half for working. So I said, well, wait a minute. I’m working real hard here for half the money that I used to be working here, and if I can go out someplace and work just to replace that 50 percent, and if I’m in private—I’m a lawyer. If I’m in private practice I get more per hour than I get here, so it shouldn’t take me 50 percent of the time to make 50 percent of the money. I would have all that extra time available, and still be making the same or more money, and I’d be doing new things. Let me see. That took about—I’m joking if I said it only took me about twenty seconds, but really, we talked about it and I knew I was getting tired of the job.\\n\\n I had been there a long time and the things that I had gone in wanting to do, the turnover of the place, the putting it in order—when I went down to Headquarters from Goddard, there were no computers. There was two computers in the entire office, and they were running these inane little programs that did everything in codes that nobody knew anything about. They were still using [IBM] Selectrics when I went down there. A couple of them had like one-page-memory things.\\n\\n We had no computerized docket systems to tell us what litigation we were involved in or anything. I’ve got all that stuff put in. We got everything up to date. I can’t claim credit for all of that. They were part of the whole thing. But I certainly was an agitator for it from the function—the program offices always had money and always had this kind of stuff. The functional offices do not have budgets, and are subsidized, essentially, are always the poor sister of the whole thing. But I was always up there yelling and screaming at these meetings, and doing stuff, and I think had some impact on that.\\n\\n So I really accomplished what I wanted to do while I was there, and I couldn’t see what I was really going to accomplish by doing it for another one, two, or three years. I certainly wasn’t going to do it for another five, just because you’ve got to stop sometime, and it just seemed like it was the time."

        "utterance": "The first time I was involved with political appointees is when I was in—I mean directly; I always was involved with them as the Navy and that sort of stuff, but where I was working directly for them and reporting directly to them, other than the General Counsel at Navy, but that’s slightly different, was at Selective Service.\\n\\n After Reagan was elected, but before he had gotten around to replacing the Director of Selective Service, so we still had the Carter director there, I went down to the Federal Executive Institute for a three-week thing, which they send new SES to a lot, and they brought down a busload of new Reagan political appointees. These people—we’re new; they’re brand new. They’ve not met us. They don’t know anything about—all I know is that we are reasonably young—I was thirty-three—career employees who have just made it to the SES level, and that we’re going to be in charge. They came in and said things like, “The only thing that career government employees do is get in the way of the political agenda and the mandate we’ve been given. People in the SES are nothing but deadwood retired in place, waiting for their retirement so they can take care of their advantages. If we had our way, we would fire every single one of you.”\\n\\n That was when I was introduced to a whole mass of political appointees together at once. After I got RIF’d out, I had said I was not going to ever work directly for a political appointee again. [Laughs] And you saw how well I did that.\\n\\n Every administration comes in, and the Reagan administration really had what it felt was a strong mandate to change things dramatically. They had a very different view of what the role of government was and what should happen, and they really felt that NASA, especially after the loss of Challenger, was an obstacle to doing what they wanted to do, and they were very upfront and very hostile about it. So that was really a difficult period of time.\\n\\n Every administration—Republican, Democrat, doesn’t matter—comes in, believes that they have the mandate to change everything, and that the people who are in the senior government career positions really are holdovers from the last administration; that’s how they got to that position anyhow; and they’re suspect loyalty. They all do that.\\n\\n I received my distinguished rank in the last year of George [H.W.] Bush Sr., and the awards ceremony was held during the first year of the [William Jefferson] Clinton administration. Every year before that, if you got distinguished rank you were invited to the White House. You got to shake the hand of the President. They had a picture taken, and all that sort of stuff. This year the Clinton administration was so suspect of these awards, that nothing was ever done with the White House. We never got any recognition from the President or anything, even though that’s the highest possible award you can get. They had a dinner, but the highest-ranking person they would send was the Administrator of the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency]; not even a member of the [U.S.] Cabinet.\\n\\n I’m telling you that that one period of time was really hostile in the Reagan administration. The Clinton administration ignored the whole group completely. In other administrations, I would go over to the White House and deal with White House Counsel fairly frequently. We would talk about issues. There used to be a thing called the Federal Legal Counsel, where the General Counsel of all the things would get together.\\n\\n In the Clinton administration, they wanted nothing to do with it at all. We never had any meetings. They never did anything. If I got three calls from the White House Counsel’s Office during the Clinton administration, it would be a lot. And it’s just a different way of the way they look at things. Unless you have actually done something with a specific human being, and worked with them enough so that they now know what you’re doing and capable of doing, every administration mistrusts the career leadership. They always think they’re there to prevent them from doing what they were elected to do. And that gets tiring after a while. It’s not a big pull on you all the time, but it’s a little pull. It’s sort of like catching a big fish with a five-pound test-line, you know. That fish could snap that in a second, but if you just keep it on and it’s always five pounds, eventually they get tired. And eventually you get tired.\\n\\n That’s why when I could retire, I also knew I was going to move away from Washington. I’d been in Washington for thirty-seven years, and I was tired of the politics. I am the career guy. I always wanted to be a career guy. I never wanted to be a political guy. I would refuse any offer to become a political guy. But I just needed to get away from it, because everything—and if you haven’t lived in Washington and worked in Washington and seen it, people won’t believe it, but everything is politics. I don’t care. I don’t care if it’s the color of the pad of paper, or the budget for something as simple as—certainly, you think, what should be so political about school lunches? But you know from reading the papers that that’s really political. Everything. There is nothing under any circumstances that you can say, do, or anything, doesn’t matter what mission it is or whatever, that is not politics. And I understand that.\\n\\n NASA Headquarters has always done a very good job of protecting—I think too good of a job—of protecting the Centers from recognizing that. The Centers usually believe that they get their budgets and they get their programs because of things like scientific merit and things like that, and it’s not true. They get it because of the politics of the situation in the time, and it’s politically right for the people to vote that way because it’s going to get them more votes, and it’ll help them get reelected, or it’ll do whatever else it is, but it’s all politics. That’s just the way the system works. I’m not arguing against that, because I don’t know what else you’d do. I think it is almost everywhere. It’s just that personally, I find it very tiring. Found it very tiring after thirty-seven years in Washington, D.C., and thirty-two years working in the federal government."

I actually think that if he had stayed three or four years and left, he’d still be known as one of the best Administrators NASA ever had. I think he came in and he shook up an organization that seriously needed being shaken up. He was a little bit too hard, I thought, on a couple of people, but to be honest, that was probably quibbling.\\n\\n But what happened is his style was creating this kind of chaos, and you can only do it a certain amount of times, and after a while you get numb. And I think the organization finally became numb. He would go off and do anything, and we’d salute and we’d go off and do all this stuff, but he had lost the hearts and minds, which he had in the first couple of years.\\n\\n Having a real quick turnover in just months and stuff isn’t real good, because you really don’t get to know people and they don’t really get to measure you, and you don’t really get to measure them. A turnover rate of like once every four or five years would be fine, and I think might be good for the agency, because you start running out of new ideas and things to do after a certain number of years.\\n\\n That’s another reason why I felt that it was time; you know, it didn’t bother me that somebody else was going to come in and be General Counsel. I mean, I thought I’d come in with a pretty big reservoir of ideas, but I’d used most of them up. [Laughs] Others would come up from time to time, but it was time to move. And I think that Dan just stuck around a little bit too long. Other than that, I didn’t really care.\\n\\n Actually, the worst one for NASA, in my tenure, was Bill Graham. He was awful. He’s still around and I see him every now and then, testifying on something or whatever, but I don’t think he ever really cared about the agency, or if he did, he never showed it in a forum where I was present. It was a shame. It was a shame that he came right at that time."

I had thought that the transition would have occurred long before that, and we would have had somebody new, and it was just dragging on and dragging on and dragging on. So, initially I was thinking, yes, I’ll go do that, and do it one more time. But then when it got down toward the fall and we still hadn’t had a name or anything like that, I decided that I really couldn’t, in good conscience, wait much longer.\\n\\n At that same time, I figured, well, also, historically this has been a career job. Personally, I was very open that I wanted it to remain a career job, but I know that I made my points with Dan Goldin, actually, because he and I actually always got along. I didn’t always approve of what he did. He knew that. I told him sometimes. But I also knew what my job was and what his job was, and if he made a decision that I didn’t like, that was his decision to make and it was then my decision to go implement what I could.\\n\\n But I dealt with him from the first time his name was mentioned, long before his hearings and stuff. I met him up at the White House, and we started working on his paperwork and his issues and stuff like that. And he learned that I was somebody he could rely on and trust, and the people in the White House told him that—in fact, what he told me was that he was told that they had never seen anybody get such good support, not just from me, but from other folks he was getting it from NASA, but I was in there, of any other agency, and they thought this was just tremendous and all. So he came in and he knew he could rely on me, and he did. So I was out of the box very quickly.\\n\\n What I decided to do is, once I had made up my mind it was time, after they named Mr. [Sean] O’Keefe, I didn’t go to a single meeting with Mr. O’Keefe. I sent my Deputy and told him that story, and I told him that he needed to develop—it was going to be O’Keefe’s decision as to what was going to happen with the job, and me making a good impression on him wasn’t going to help Bob any, so it would be better if Bob made a good impression on him. So I sent [Robert M.] Bob Stephens over to do that.\\n\\n What nobody knew is that he had a college roommate and best friend, and he was the godfather of the children of Paul [G.] Pastorek, who, as far as I can tell, is a very good lawyer and is doing some very innovative and interesting things, not the way I would have done it, but I’m not there anymore, and so that’s fine. I think the organization looks like it’s doing okay. Yes, he’s done some things I wouldn’t have done, but I would expect nothing less. They didn’t want a clone. [Laughs]"

I just want to say thank you for participating in the National Archives Oral History Project documenting the 1973 National Personnel Records Center Fire and its impact on the National Archives. My name is Alyssa Moore. Today is Wednesday, June 28, 2023, and I'm speaking with Mickey McGuire. We can get started with the questions and just see where the conversation goes. If you have any questions along the way or if you want to stop on a question for a while, that's completely fine. We'll just kind of let the conversation guide us. How does that sound?"

        "utterance": "Okay. When I was a file clerk, when records were pulled to be sent to the correspondence units to answer correspondence, then they had to be returned to the files. My job was to put them back in the files where they came from, whether it was Army, Navy, or whatever files they came from. And when I was supervisor of that, then I was the supervisor of getting the records from the correspondence section, having people get them from the correspondence units, and putting them in order and getting back in file. Also we filed loose papers that needed to be inserted in the records. Maybe documents that were sent from the Department of the Army or Navy, and they needed to be put in the person's record. Then from there, I went to the accession downstairs where you accessioned the new records coming into the center. They had to be keypunched in and put into the computer system at that time. Then we had a registry file, and it didn't make any difference what service you were in, Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force, you were assigned a number and put in order in this file. That was the registry file. That's where I was at the time of the fire."

Here these files were nine shelves high in cabinets. And the records were filed by the person's service number. That was the Marine Corps. And I'm thinking, \"Wow!\" These records went back to, I mean, in the Marine Corps, went back into the 1800s and then came forward. I'm thinking, \"Wow!\" And then as you went along, you just found out that it went up to the present time. And then the Navy files were similar, only they were filed alphabetically by your name.

And so you had two files for a Navy person. The Marine Corps, their medical records were in that, too, because they were part of the Navy system. It was just interesting how that was put together.

One of the things in the correspondence section, for example, when I worked, people used to write in and want copies of something from Elvis Presley's records. His records were at the center, but they were with the Department of the Army. But they could get certain documents from that. So you'd have to get his records and they would answer it and you'd send it back. And I'm thinking, \"Wow, all the people in the world and here's a person that you’d just seen in the thing...\" But there were others like that. I remember that, I didn't see it, but they had to pull records of anybody that made national news, like when Kennedy got shot. They pulled the records and sent them to Washington. But I wasn't in on any of those as far as pulling the records are concerned."

One of the things is that being computerized helped things an awful lot because you could search on a computer and find out if you had a record on file rather quickly and then you could go and get it. Otherwise, you had to get a name and walk out there and find it alphabetically or numerically and that took a little more time. Sometimes with records where, for example, if you had Navy, you had a medical and you had a personnel record. Sometimes if you needed them both, you had to go to two different files to get it. You would still have to do that, but on a computer search, they would both come up and tell you where they were."

        "utterance": "I’ll have to back up to my time in the Air Force to properly address that, because I have been blessed with a series of assignments that built one upon the other, and it was I think more accidental than purposeful. I went to flight training right out of Texas A&M [University, College Station] and washed out. The reason I washed out is they didn’t make left-handed airplanes. I did such things as have 14 rudder control stalls in a row with no semblance of rudder control, so they properly got me out of the flight training program and put me into the aircraft maintenance business, which is what I studied in the Air Force ROTC [Reserve Officers’ Training Corps] program at A&M.\\n\\n After a brief tour with the Strategic Air Command working on B-50 [Superfortress] airplanes, which were then our leading strategic deterrent, I was given an assignment to Chanute Air Force Base Maintenance Officer School [Rantoul, Illinois], where they taught me all the ins and outs of how to take care of airplanes. I was sent directly from there to Korea. On the ship going to Korea, they had a personnel guy that came in to see where people were going to be sent once they got there. He asked the question, “Which of you guys has jet experience?” A captain friend of mine held up his hand and said, “I do, and so does my buddy Davis.” Yes, we’d had six hours of instruction in jets at Chanute, and that was our jet experience, but that was enough. Ironically enough, he was assigned to fly T-6 [Texan] airplanes as artillery spotters rather than maintenance, and I was sent to the premier fighter group on the peninsula, the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Group. About midway through my tour there as an aircraft maintenance officer they had a big reduction in force, and I was promoted to be the group maintenance officer of the premier fighter group on the peninsula, at age 23.\\n\\n A new group commander came in, and he called his squadron commanders together and said, “I want you guys to spend all your time on operations and leave maintenance up to this guy Davis.” I was in de facto command of 900 men and 85 combat airplanes at age 23, which was a fair burden. By working 14-16-hour days seven days a week, I was able to learn a great deal, so I felt like I got about three years’ experience in the rest of that tour. It was a wonderful experience, too, not only technically in terms of dealing with the aircraft problems, but in leadership of dealing with men. I had a lot of good times doing that and felt very close to these people and did all that I could to help them, which is I think the primary role of the leader—help your people.\\n\\n After Korea, I had applied for and was sent to the Air Force Institute of Technology [Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio] to get master’s level work in aerospace engineering for 18 months. It was a particularly good time to be there, although I did not get a degree because the school was not accredited. They were in the process of being accredited while I was there, so you can imagine the rigor that the professors put on the classes when they had all the accreditation officials sitting in the classes with them. I got, I thought, an excellent education in aerospace engineering, courtesy of the Air Force. I had three different offers to stay at Wright-Patterson and work in their labs, but I had toured those labs, and I’d seen entirely too many civil service technicians sitting around on the floor reading comic books, and I wanted no part of that.\\n\\n I took a three-day leave and hopped on a military airplane and went to [Air Force] Headquarters in Baltimore [Maryland] and pounded on the desk and asked to be assigned to Edwards Air Force Base [California], and they granted my wish. I took Mary [my wife] and our baby boy out to the desert, and we bought our first home in the little town of Lancaster, which is now a pretty good size metropolis. I drove the 30 miles every day in a carpool up to Edwards and worked in what was a real malassignment to me. I was an engineer and they assigned me to what they called the Technical Operations branch, where my job was to oversee the flight test programs of 20 some-odd contractor programs then underway in the so-called Century Series airplanes. It was a very intense period of activity for Edwards. It’s only been matched, I think, once in the years since."

        "utterance": "I went there in 1955, and I resigned from the Air Force and returned to Texas because Mary was concerned about her folks getting old in 1958. It was mid-October 1958. I went to work for Chance Vought Aircraft in Dallas, where I ended up in preliminary design working on advanced systems. About two and a half years into that [President John F.] Kennedy said, “We’re going to the Moon.” I said, “That’s interesting.” Then [Vice President Lyndon B.] Johnson said, “We’re doing it from Houston.” I said, “I’m gone.” So I called up and got an appointment and went down to Houston and interviewed with first Joe [Joseph N.] Kotanchik and then with Max [Maxime A.] Faget himself, which apparently he didn’t do that often. But I was recommended by Walt [Walter C.] Williams, who I knew at Edwards when he was running the NASA flight test center there at Edwards Air Force Base.\\n\\n My acquaintance with Walt came about because one of my first assignments in Center Operations was to find out how we could get the F-105 [Thunderchief] airplanes up from South Base to North Base where they had a new hangar for them. To get there we had to either cross the lakebed or go on a taxiway that went through the parking lot of Walt Williams’s flight test center, located was midway between Main Base and North Base. The lakebed got wet most winters.\\n\\n I had to go up and deal with this crusty character, who had a very strong reputation, to talk him into letting us put in two gates and to open the gates and move his aircraft to where we could get through on the occasions we needed to move the airplanes. Much to everybody’s surprise, Walt agreed. He was very nice during my visit with him. I was quaking in my boots the whole time because of the man’s reputation, which I think you know.\\n\\n Apparently Max called him and said, “What do you think of this guy Davis?” He must have given me a good report, because they hired me as a [Government Service (GS)]-14 when I was expecting a 13, and they put me in charge of the power and propulsion office under Caldwell [C.] Johnson in the Program Office.\\n\\n There was a great flurry of activity in those days. I got there, on a Thursday in late March of 1962, and I reported to my boss Caldwell Johnson. One of the first things I asked him was, “Okay, Mr. Johnson, I’m here, now please tell me how we’re going to do this thing, because it seems to me that going to the Moon and back is a pretty difficult task.” His answer was crude, but that was Caldwell. He said, “How the hell should I know? That’s why we hired a bunch of bright guys like you.” Which took me aback big time, because at that time we hadn’t decided on the mode of going to the Moon.\\n\\n I got there in March, and it wasn’t until July that John [C.] Houbolt won the fuss about going with Lunar Orbit Rendezvous. We had a lot of decisions that were held up during that interval. In the meantime, we were proceeding to try to develop the engine that had to fire on the back side of the Moon, the Service Propulsion Engine; and the Pratt & Whitney fuel cells, which we had to have for drinking water and electricity; develop the reaction control jets that held the attitude of the vehicle; the launch escape system, which had the two motors: the launch escape motor and the tower jettison motor by different contractors. All those contracts had been let when I arrived, but they were in the very early formative stages for all of them.\\n\\n The job I had in the power systems branch was to oversee on the part of the government, the conduct of these subcontractors and North American [Aviation, Inc.], the prime contractor, in carrying out those developments."

The propulsion engineer at Edwards had total complete control of what was done to those engines, and they had only a tech rep [technical representative] from the contractor. They did all the work in house; so he got some really wonderful rocket engine experience. So I called up my friend Don. I said, “Don, come join me, I need you.” He came in as my deputy, which was a great blessing to me. So you might want to talk with Don sometime. He’s still there.

Later an even more challenging situation arose on the Lunar Module ascent engine, which was among my responsibilities. There I got an unusual assignment from NASA. When we went to Bell [Aircraft] for a program review, it became apparent to those of us that were reviewing the program, including some high level NASA management that went with me on that one, that Bell had essentially given up on solving the problems of combustion stability on the Lunar Module ascent engine.\\n\\n They didn’t know what to do next. We broke the procurement rules by deciding to give a sole source contract to Rocketdyne [Division of North American]. I was assigned to go out and talk with the boss at Rocketdyne, a crusty old gentleman named Sam Hoffman, and persuade him to take on the job of accepting the existing valve package and combustion chamber that Bell had designed that was successful, and mating it with a Rocketdyne injector that was where the combustion stability problem arose, and put the Rocketdyne good name and nameplate on it."

If you don’t, the Russians are going to beat us.” Well, he did.\\n\\n Another good friend that I’d worked with at Edwards named Bill Wilson was assigned as the NASA engineer. Bill is still out in Los Angeles [California]. Bill was assigned as the NASA engineer to work with the really bright young engineer that Rocketdyne assigned to do this job—Steve Domokos was his name. He drove hard on this thing, and they came up with an amazingly simple fix that solved the stability problem. They put what we called the tomato can in the propellant line, which changed the dynamics of the feed system and resolved the problem. They had an existing injector that worked very well and gave high efficiency. That became the Lunar Module ascent engine that worked to perfection every time it was tried. There were several near miracles that occurred on my watch that were done by others, not by me. I had a part to play in causing them to happen, which was very satisfying to me.\\n\\n Then we had a fellow named Jim [James C.] Elms came down as Deputy Director of the Center, and he observed that we’d had a group that came down under Max Faget from [NASA] Langley Research Center [Hampton, Virginia]; some 900 technical people that were given no responsibilities in the Apollo Program other than to develop new technologies that might be applied later. Those of us at the Program Office were still burdened with doing all the stuff, and we called it Max’s Hobby Shop. Jim Elms observed that it was indeed Max’s Hobby Shop. He decided to fix that, and he did so by setting up what became the subsystem manager system that they assigned the technical people to direct technical responsibility.\\n\\n Once again I had a crossroads in my career, because I thought I was going to be working for Guy [Joseph G.] Thibodaux in the power and propulsion division that he was going to head up, having the subsystem management work that I’d been doing for a year and a half or two years. I worked for a chap named Bob [Robert O.] Piland. Bob called me into his office and said, “No, you’re not going to E&D [Engineering and Development], you’re a Program Office guy, and you’re going to stay with us.” I said, “Well, okay, Bob, what do you got in mind for me to do?” He gave me another pretty challenging assignment. He said, “I want you to plan and manage the ground test program for the Apollo spacecraft, all of it.” I said, “Okay, I’ll do my best.” It was again another one of these massive challenges that was handed to me."

        "utterance": "Yes. I knew what many of the problems were and many of the more important things. I knew very little, of course, about such things as guidance and navigation. There was always a little conflict between us, because part of our troubles in the propulsion group were caused by them insisting on using what they called the pulse mode of control for these reaction control engines. They sent them a series of signals, “rrr-rr” [imitates sound], and the valves had to open and close in that chattering thing. The reason they did that is because that was easier on the guidance people than sending proper commands to the engines.\\n\\n But any damn fool knew that the most critical parts of operating a rocket engine are starting and stopping. That’s when you’re most likely to blow the thing up. I objected to the business, said we ought to use the pulse-duration modulation, which means that you turn the engine on and run it for a discrete interval of time to make it work, then turn it off. I was turned down because the guidance people held on to their “rrr” mode of controlling the bird, and we had to live with it. Now that was I thought stark insanity, but we did it, and we got by with it. But that was another difficulty we faced.\\n\\n Planning the ground test program, with the background of having worked in that area for that length of time and that intensely, was a great help. I did triage on the ground test program, where I went through everything that people had suggested be done for a ground test and made a determination as best I could as to which ones were unnecessary, and there was a bunch of that—ones were done more frequently than they needed to be. The rule I used was that we wanted to do everything that’s needed to be done once, but unless there’s very good reason, only once in the test program. We applied that rule, and the subsystem people had to defend what they proposed to do to me and a group of people I gathered.\\n\\n We made the determination of what ground tests would be done. That included what we called the combined systems tests, where you had more than one subsystem involved in the test program. Such things as LTA-8 [Lunar Excursion Module Test Article], which was the thermal vacuum test article, was the first time we had the occasion to put all the subsystems in the Lunar Module. It was tested in Chamber B at Building 32 [Space Environment Simulation Laboratory] with John [S.] Bull and Jim [James B.] Irwin aboard. That was a manned test in a vacuum chamber, which was not quite as critical as the lunar program, but it was critical enough."

These two guys were fighting like cats and dogs, and I had to go out there and get them together. I said, “Look, you guys are officers and gentlemen by act of Congress, now behave yourselves that way.” It got their attention, and they learned how to get along, which I thought was great.\\n\\n I got out of the Air Force as a captain, and these guys were retired colonels, but they listened to me. That was good. I still have a lot of friends that retired from White Sands that were some of the leading lights in running that program. They did a really good job.\\n\\n When the ground test program was coming to a close and we’d finished our tests, we then had the flight vehicles coming down the line. They set up the flight test group I was put into then. There were five lead guys, all of us GS-15s. We had a terrible time trying to figure out who was responsible for what. I went to the boss, who was then Owen [G.] Morris, and I said, “Owen, I want to draw on my Air Force experience and make a suggestion on how to deal with this. Let’s assign each of us a tail number where there’s a specific vehicle that we’re responsible for, and then there’s no confusion as to who does what amongst the five of us, and we rotate to the next five when these five are finished.” He said, “Okay.” That’s where the vehicle management concept came from.\\n\\n We didn’t call it crew chief, because crew chiefs are sergeants, and we were all the equivalent of colonels. If we wanted to keep our pay scale, we had to have some title other than crew chief, but that’s really what it amounted to, being crew chief on one of the vehicles.\\n\\n Now it was arguably more important, because of the mission and the cost and the size of a Lunar Module as opposed to an airplane. It was the same task at hand of keeping very close track of a specific piece of hardware to be sure that it met all its requirements and had been handled properly and was built and assembled as it should have been. In that capacity, I spent most of my time at Bethpage [New York, headquarters of Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation]. I was in the Lunar Module part, and there was a similar group that was assigned on the Command and Service Module under another guy besides Owen [Morris]. I think maybe it was [Rolf Lanscron], but I’m not sure.\\n\\n That went on through the LTA-8 program; that was my first one. That was a challenge because the LTA-8 was the first time we had the occasion to design and execute the factory tests and then the tests at the field Center, in our case JSC rather than the Cape [Canaveral, Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida] on a vehicle with all of its subsystems installed. We had to define what these tests would be, what the limits on all the parameters would be, and how we went about doing it, in great detail, and to document the procedures to be used in conducting the tests. That involved a lot of work."

So, in my opinion, the Apollo workforce was 98 percent pure, and we didn’t suffer the two percent very long. I think most everyone that worked on the Program had the mindset that we were engaged in fierce warfare with the Soviet Union as to which society was a superior way of organizing human beings. The arguments that we had were secondary to the common cause that we had. It really was, to my way of thinking, warfare that we were engaged in, as much so as when I was in Korea.

And it wasn’t at all clear that we were going to do so until we did it. Along those lines, one of my proudest accomplishments in the Apollo Program, I may have mentioned to you before, was when they were setting up the program, they set it up with missions with letter designation to them. LM-5 was not intended to be the first to land. It was intended to be the last to not land. It was to be flown in July of ’69. LM-6 was in October, as I recall. The program manager decided that they’d make very sure that LM-6 and beyond had the minimum possible weight. They had what they called SWIP, Super Weight Improvement Program, with Grumman, where Grumman was not only on a cost plus fee basis, but in addition they were given a bonus of $10,000 for each pound of weight they could shave off the Lunar Module, beginning with Lunar Module 6. My bird, LM-5, did not get the benefit of that, so it was a bit heavier.\\n\\n When we got some new notice about the progress the Russians were making, it was a little scary. I told my assistant Roger [D.] Hicks that we needed to do something to reexamine whether or not we had the ability to land LM-5 on the Moon. He did an analysis that I participated in, and we concluded that if the guys would throw the backpacks out the door before they closed the hatch, if they’d take the big heavy notebooks with flight plans that were for descent only and throw them out of the hatch before they closed it and prepared to get off the Moon, and most importantly, if the Configuration Change Board chaired by George Low would hold the line exactly in weight for 18 long months between then and when we flew, that LM-5 could make it.\\n\\n So I went to George with this story when we got it put together. I said, “George, I have a Sicilian offer for you. How would you like to have LM-5 be able to land in July rather than waiting for LM-6 in October? It might make the difference between winning and losing.” Well, what could he say?\\n\\n So he did, and he was able to hold the line on the weight. Now we have Buzz Aldrin talking to people saying, “This is the guy that gave me a heavyweight LM, and we damn near crashed.” I’ll stand up and say, “No, Buzz, it was pilot error.” That breaks up the crowd, of course, but getting Lunar Module 5 to land was one of my proudest achievements. I want to show you a letter that George Low sent to me after the mission. [Retrieves letter] It’s been eaten by the bugs, so you’ll have to pardon me, but the thing you need to look at is the handwritten note at the bottom."

We had a lot of adventures getting the vehicle ready to go.\\n\\n One of the most frightening ones was after we shipped the Lunar Module to the Cape, somebody came up with the idea that we were subject to stress corrosion where the joints in the descent stage were put together because they had not used a zinc chromate finish on the aluminum part. The high strength aluminum alloy 7075 was found to be vulnerable to stress corrosion, which meant that the corner fittings might fail. After we had the descent module all thoroughly checked out in Bethpage and shipped it to the Cape, the order came out that they had to disassemble the thing, take it apart to the piece parts, use the zinc chromate material on it, and then use shims to be sure that there wasn’t any eccentricity in the joints, and then put it back together and check it out again.\\n\\n It was really a terrible situation for me to go out and look in the hangar and see my nice descent stage laid out in piece parts on kraft paper on the hangar floor. But we did it, and we got by with it. That was another occasion where something greater than us was at work, because it all went back together well. And I never will forget the fact that one of the tubing fittings leaked. The leak occurred at an elbow joint that was just an inch or two out from where it disappeared behind structure, and we had to replace that joint. They had the best welder that Grumman had, go out there and unbraze this fitting, take it out, and put a new one in and braze it back again, and just pray that it didn’t leak again. He did, and it did not leak. We must have had 20 people gathered around watching him while he was doing that."

There was an issue that came up between a guy at the Cape and me as to whether or not we had the ability to turn around the next day if we had to stop for some reason. The KSC guy raised alarm that no, the supercritical helium will heat it up too much, and we’d be out of limits and couldn’t go. My numbers said otherwise, so we had that discussion on the loop with George Low listening. He finally said, “You guys get off the loop and solve this offline.” We did, and I won the fuss, but that was not even necessary, because we didn’t have to wait. We launched the day we intended to. That’s some of my adventures. I hope that helps."

He’s a guy that in recent years has said, “We don’t have any shortage of petroleum, all you have to do is dig deep enough, because it’s near the core of the Earth in such huge quantities that we could never consume.” He’s the sort of guy that brings up those sorts of matters. He’s the guy that said, “You land on the Moon, you’re going to sink 10 or 20 meters deep into the soil, and you’ll never hear from them again.” So we had to go with the Ranger and Surveyor Programs to find out whether that was true or not. Obviously when LM-5 landed, the footprints were perhaps an inch or inch and a half deep, no more."

I stopped going to Bethpage because they knew what they were doing well enough to where I wasn’t going to be of any help, so I stayed home and talked to them on the phone. I was assigned to LM-15, and that was dullsville compared to where I’d been. I did a little study on something, I forget what it was, and went to show it to Max Faget. He found out that I could even draw a picture, which amazed him, that a guy from the Program Office could draw something. He offered me a job to work in what he called his Special Projects Office.\\n\\n He set me up sharing a little office adjacent to his own with Jack [John M.] Eggleston, who was a friend and neighbor. Jack was the head of the Special Projects Office, and I was his sole employee. Max said, “I want you to take a look at something for me.” I said, “What’s that?” He said, “I have a suspicion that this nuclear stage that they’re working on in Huntsville makes no sense if the [Space] Shuttle can meet its goal. I want you to do a study and compare for me the effectiveness of the nuclear stage to a chemical stage or stages.” They had been spending $100 million a year for 10 years on the engine, and they were about to give Marshall another $100 million a year for 10 years to build a nuclear stage.\\n\\n I got with a friend in Mission Planning named Jack Funk. He was the trajectory analysis expert. He and I did such things as fly to Mars five times overnight with 10-inch slide rules. That was before we had pocket calculators, never mind computers. Well, there were computers, but they were operated behind glass doors by these people in white suits, and you’d go give them something to do and go back three days later to pick up the results. That was what we had to work with in Apollo and the years immediately after. So Jack and I got together and examined what people were saying at Huntsville and [NASA] Headquarters [Washington, D.C.] about this nuclear stage.\\n\\n One of the first things I noted was they planned to bring it back and dock it with the [International] Space Station. Looking at that engine, once you pull the rods on the nuclear reactor, it’s radioactive from then on for 10,000 years. They were going to use this thing to fly from low-Earth orbit to the Moon and then come back and dock at the Space Station. The shield they had on it to protect people from nuclear radiation was good only for 15 degrees either side of the centerline. If you had the nuclear stage come back and dock and move 16 degrees, it’d kill everybody aboard the Space Station. If you failed to dock and it entered the biosphere, you might contaminate Paris [France] or New York or London [England] or whatever with radioactive material from the reactor.\\n\\n So there was a very strong disadvantage, in my view, of using nuclear power, and still is—unless you’re at what’s called C3 [characteristic energy]. That’s called excess hyperbolic velocity. C3 is reached when you’re escaping from the Solar System. So unless you can use a chemical system to get you to where you’re not going to be returning to the biosphere ever, you ought not to pull the rods on a reactor. But if you want to go way far off and you can get that velocity, okay, go ahead, use it. I still have that point of view, but the nuclear people keep coming back with what they call a nuclear safe altitude where if you put it at 5,000 miles, the chances of it coming back are sufficiently small that you ought to be able to tolerate it. Well, I don’t buy that, thank you."

        "utterance": "First work for Max Faget and his so-called Special Projects Office. The next thing he had me take on was a thing called a Space Tug, which was another Marshall project that they’d been spending big money on, which was a hydrogen-oxygen propellant upper stage. The requirement that Marshall had set for it, and Headquarters, was to take 3,000 pounds of payload out of the Shuttle payload bay with this thing called the Tug, go to geostationary orbit, drop it off, pick up another 3,000-pound item, and return it to the Shuttle. That’s an exceedingly difficult mission, and it requires cryogenic propellants.\\n\\n But the downside of that is that if you have an abort while you’re carrying this thing, you’re going to lose the whole thing. The reason being that hydrogen leaks out through metal walls. It’s the world’s smallest molecule, and hydrogen will leak out through anything. So you had to assume that you have a Shuttle payload bay filled with hydrogen gas, and if you enter the atmosphere with the [Shuttle] Orbiter, it has vents that allow atmospheric air with its oxygen to come back into the bay. All it would take would be one spark, and it would destroy the Orbiter and its contents and its crew.\\n\\n I looked at that, and I said, “We ought not to do this thing. It’s damn well dangerous.” Max said, “I agree with you. What can we do?” Then he said, “I tell you what. Let’s give them something that they can’t get the propellant out of it unless they have a steam wand and a spoon.” That is, a solid rocket upper stage.\\n\\n By that time Special Projects Office was off somewhere else, Building 45 as I remember, and I had five or six people working for me then. That seemed to be my favorite number for subordinates, something between five and ten. I had this guy look at what we needed to have. By that time, the contractor reps [representatives] were coming by to see me frequently, because I kept a blackboard with my wish list of things I’d like to have studied written on it, and these would change from time to time as we’d decide not to do it or we got money to do it and it was no longer a wish list.\\n\\n These guys that worked for Boeing [Airplane Company] and North American [Rockwell Corporation] and Thiokol [Chemical Company] and others would come around and ask if they could copy what’s on my board. I said, “Of course you can.” So they did. About two thirds of the time, in a few weeks I’d get a call and somebody had a briefing they wanted to give me where they’d gone off and done the study on their own time, and I didn’t have to get money out of Headquarters to do it because they’d offered it without that. I became known as a “thief in the night” by the contractor guys in a good-natured way. They didn’t object to doing that, they were glad to do it. We were able to get a lot of work done without having to deal with Headquarters and all the bureaucracy they put in the way."

Later on when it was obvious it wasn’t going to be interim, it’s permanent, it became the Inertial Upper Stage. I don’t recall whether the number of times it flew was closer to 25 or 50 missions with the Shuttle. George Low indicated some concerns when he was Deputy Administrator about whether the Shuttle could compete with the Delta launch vehicle or not. So he said, “Let’s see what we can do with a Delta class of payloads, and how would you propose to do that.” I went off and did a study I called the “Delta Killer.” They later changed its name from that ugly term to being the PAM-D, Payload Assist Module-Delta. It was a simple platform. You’d raise up the payload with a solid rocket motor attached to it in the payload bay and use an electric motor to spin it up to stabilize it, and then let it go and get a safe distance away and fire the solid rocket motor, and it did the same thing the Delta did.\\n\\n A larger version was called PAM-A, which was a larger motor designed to replicate what the Atlas/Centaur [rocket] could do. It flew a few times, but not as many. The PAM-D is used to this day as an upper stage on a Delta launch vehicle. Those three items were brought to fruition from work done in my little office. I had a lot of help from Thiokol on the IUS.\\n\\n The Air Force in their wisdom saw fit to give the motor job to Chemical Systems Division, their competitor, which had a lot of trouble with it. Boeing had done the study and said it was going to cost something like $20 million a copy. By the time the Air Force and Chemical Systems Division and Boeing got through with it, the IUS cost $50 million a copy, which was not necessary. But you can’t win them all."

Just a few months before I took early retirement, Max reassigned me from that job to be his representative to the Shuttle Program Office. My job was to sit in these Configuration Change Boards and handle those problems I felt I could handle and run up three flights of stairs to get him for those that needed his attendance. I sat in those dull six-hour-long meetings talking about such things as, “Should we remove the lights from the centerline of the runway at the Cape?” They spent five hours on that subject when it was immediately obvious that, one: the computer landed the machine and didn’t need the lights, number two: they were only used at night and we didn’t plan any night landings, and number three: it was a lead-pipe cinch—if you hit the thing with the nosewheel tire when it’s heavily loaded it was going to blow. So it became obvious in the first 20 minutes of that discussion what ought to be done: take the damn lights out, but they talked about it for five hours.\\n\\n I put up with that for three or four months and never had occasion to run upstairs. Then the early out opportunity came along. One of my friends came by and said, “What are you going to do about early out, Hu?” I said, “Well, I don’t know, I don’t know what job I’ll get, but I understand a lot of the old-timers are going to retire.” He said, “No, dummy, I mean you. I came in about the same time you did, and I had about the same military time you did, and I’m eligible, and I think you are.” I said, “Do you still have a copy of the memo? I threw mine in the wastebasket because I knew it didn’t apply to me.” He gave it to me, and sure enough including counting my two-week active duty tour after I left active duty in the Air Force, I barely qualified for the early out at age 48. So I took it because I was bored with the job that Max had given to me, and I didn’t want to hang around anymore."

So one day a fellow named Bass Redd that worked in the Orbiter design shop came by and said, “Tell me where the payload CG [Center of Gravity] is, Hu, we got to put the wing on this thing.” I ran the numbers with the mirror of the telescope in the aft end and the LOX [Liquid Oxygen] tank of the tug in the aft end, and biased the payload CG aft to account for those matters. As a consequence, to this day we must carry all the weight in the rear end that we can as ballast. And we still have an overload problem on the nose gear because the CG of the Orbiter with its payload today for every flight except to place Hubble has been much forward of where you’d like it to be.

We had a fellow named John [H.] Disher that ran the advanced systems shop at NASA Headquarters, and he became a fan of what we did, and he saw to it that we got a dribble and drabble of funds, but we never got more than 20 percent of what this other group had received. I was able to get things like a little $50,000 award from Headquarters to study making use of lunar resources to build a power satellite. A guy that became a close friend at General Dynamics [Corporation] named Ed [Edward] Bock headed this little $50,000 study, which they put a lot more than that into it, I think. He found that if we built a base on the Moon and developed the resources of the Moon, we could get 90 percent of the mass needed for the power satellite construction from lunar materials, because of the one-sixth gravity field of the Moon was ever so much easier and cheaper to get from the Moon’s surface to geostationary orbit than to get from the Earth’s surface to geostationary orbit. And it might make the difference between power satellite being economical and not. That was done for $50,000, and that study to this day has held up as being an accurate representation of what we could do. It wasn’t optimistic enough to suit the space colonization crowd. They did a study and said, “No, it’s not 90 percent, it’s 99 percent.” Well, hooey, who cares? Nine percent isn’t worth the additional problems, I don’t think.\\n\\n But another issue that came up somewhere in that period was how you ought to go about building a Space Station. I was asked by Frank Borman to join his group when he headed the first Space Station study out of Houston, to leave Max’s group and go to work for him. I turned it down. The reason I turned it down is they were concentrating on what was known then as the modular Space Station, which is the way we ended up building it. I said, “That’s foolishness. You don’t want to put up a Tinkertoy set. You want to build a heavy lift vehicle and put it up in no more than three or four pieces with a heavy lift bird rather than trying to put the thing together with all those EVAs and all that difficulty, because it’s going to cost you a lot more and take a lot more time.” They said, “Well, we need to look at both.” I said, “Okay, thank you, but no thanks.” So I turned down that job. I think I was proven correct in that, but the hard way, because they went ahead and did it. We spent far more money and time and effort to build that thing than was justified. We could have had both a heavy lift vehicle and the Space Station for far less money than we spent on the Space Station itself. That was another one of NASA’s several missteps in recent years, in my view."

        "utterance": "I’ll be happy to, that’s my favorite subject yet today. When I was running the Future Programs shop for Max, I had a visitor from Arthur D. Little [Inc., management consulting firm] named Dr. Peter [E.] Glaser. Peter had come out with this story that was printed in the journal, Physics Today, where he said, “We can generate all of mankind’s electrical power most efficiently if we put satellites the size of Manhattan Island [New York] in geostationary orbit and beam the power to Earth with a microwave, pick it up with a thing called a rectenna, and turn it into DC power for the high voltage transmission lines.” Peter wanted to see me and talk to me about his concept. I, of course, accepted. He came down, and I heard him out. I said, “Well, that’s interesting, Peter, but I know there’s got to be a fatal flaw. I tell you what, I’ll see if I can find it, and if I do, I’ll let you know what it is.”\\n\\n That cost me three days and four nights of a Thanksgiving weekend running numbers on an accounting pad with a pocket calculator. Yes, I had a pocket calculator by then. I did not find a fatal flaw. So I called Peter up and said, “I think you’ve got something.” He said, “Okay, what are we going to do about it?” I said, “Well, I’ll see what I can figure out.” I talked to Max about it, and he wouldn’t even broach the subject with me. He said, “No, that’s too far out for me. I’m not going to listen to you, but if you can persuade Guy Thibodaux,” who was his roommate at LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge] and headed his Power and Propulsion Division, “if you can persuade Guy, I’ll listen to both of you.” So I set to and took my analysis over, and Guy heard me out and came to agree with me.\\n\\n We went to Max, and he listened, and he came to agree with us. Then Max took it to Chris Kraft and he became the world’s foremost advocate of solar power satellites. At that particular moment, NASA had an Assistant Administrator for Energy. That was a very brief assignment, but they had an Assistant Administrator for Energy briefly headed up by Dr. Jack [Harrison] Schmitt. Chris took the thing to Jack. Jack took it to the Department of Energy. The two of them went to Congress, and they got the $19 million Boeing and North American studies funded.\\n\\n I asked to head the one at JSC. Bob Piland, who had by then been put between Max and myself, instead gave the job to Clarke Covington. I was given the subordinate job of working on the space transportation part only of the solar power satellite, which turns out to be the impediment of why we’re not doing it today. So it was I think a pretty important job. We did the study, and we came out with the conclusion from both the Department of Energy and NASA that it’s technically feasible, but that its costs were a factor of between five and ten higher than it needed to be to be competitive with coal-based power.\\n\\n That was 35 years ago, but technology has advanced tremendously since then. It’s my view that what we desperately need to do as a society is to go back and review the bidding on the power satellites’ cost-effectiveness compared to the now-increased costs of clean coal power. Since we did the study 35 years ago, technology has advanced. We thought we might get 15 or 16 percent efficiency out of solar cells. Well, today they’re routinely getting well above 30 percent. The satellite mass in those days for a 10-million-kilowatt station was 100,000 tons. Today, I think we could get that same satellite up for about 23,000 to 25,000 tons—roughly one fourth of what we had then. This is important, because it reduces the burden of transportation by a factor of four or more.\\n\\n It is very likely that if the study was done honestly today that we would have a cost-effective solar power satellite at our disposal to solve, not just for a while, but for all time mankind’s needs for energy. Generating the power in geostationary orbit rather than here on Earth, the waste heat, which 30 percent efficient cells put out 70 percent of the heat as waste heat. If you radiate it into space rather than putting it in the biosphere, you can use something like 40 percent more electrical energy here on Earth with no more thermal burden on our planet. So I think it’s a vitally important thing for society at large to do this. We waited 35 years, and it’s doubtful to me whether we still have the ability to do it, never mind the 35 years we ended up spending the nation’s treasury on far Mid-East oil. I think we desperately need to go back and do the study again.\\n\\n About two and a half years ago I was greatly encouraged when a small office in the Pentagon that has no money, but does have some very bright young officers, picked up and said, “Hey, there’s a niche market for the military here, because look what’s going on in Iraq. We’re spending huge sums of money to carry diesel oil from the ports in Kuwait to where the troops need it in Iraq. The enemy has roadside bombs, and we’re losing a lot of people.” It’s their opinion that the cost of a kilowatt-hour in Iraq is somewhere between $1 and $10 rather than what we pay, which is, before you put it on the transmission system, maybe a nickel a kilowatt-hour. They have an incentive to have this thing for their purposes without regard for the kind of cost difference that might exist. I think if we used lunar materials for that 90 percent of the mass that we can beat the cost that we’re paying today for electrical power by building power satellites from the Moon.\\n\\n That means that we got to get with it with regard to the Moon. Not with people, necessarily, but with an aggressive robotic program. My priorities for NASA today are twofold. Number one is people aren’t going to believe you have low-cost launch services until you do it. We’ve got to go ahead and not have NASA manage such a program, because Marshall has had about six different tries and they’ve blown every one of them. It’s time to stop that foolishness and find out what it would take in terms of incentives to have the private sector pick up developing this heavy lift launch vehicle that we need.\\n\\n There’s today a big competition going on, because the Shuttle program manager has funded a little bit of work at JSC to come up with what they call a Side-Mount Shuttle-derived vehicle. Well, the Shuttle-derived vehicle is something else that I did for Max in the Future Programs Office in the early ’70s. He called me over one day and said, “I want you to look at something, Hu.” I said, “What’s that?” He said, “What can we put up with the Space Shuttle propulsive package if we don’t have the Orbiter present?” I said, “When do you want it?” He said, “How about a week?” I said, “How about 10 days?” He said, “Oh. Okay.”\\n\\n So in 10 days I went back to him with some charts and said, “Yes we can do it, and it’ll put up 150,000 to 160,000 pounds of payload, and we can recover the engines”—which at that time cost $50 million apiece—“by putting a heat shield on 1307.” That’s the bulkhead between the aft section and midsection of the Orbiter. “Quartz cloth down the sidewall.” Put it down with three huge parachutes on the King Ranch [Kingsville, Texas]. If we hit a cow, we pay for a barbecue and invite all the cowboys. Then once we recover it with a big lumber carrier like Schlumberger [Limited, oilfield company] builds, we take it out to twin piers in Laguna Madre [Gulf of Mexico] and put it on a barge and carry it back to the Cape and use it again.” And that we called the Shuttle-derived vehicle.\\n\\n Headquarters said, “Hey, that’s a really neat idea. Marshall, go off and design us a Shuttle-derived vehicle.” Marshall did so. And they decided they had to add the Shuttle midbody to it, which is made out of boron-epoxy and is a terribly expensive piece of business. They put all the bells and whistles on it, and the thing collapsed under its own cost because they made it far more complicated than they needed to.\\n\\n That subject has come up again. Mack [Edward M.] Henderson at JSC has done a study with my friend Jack [John] Frassanito who owns a graphic artist company under contract to the Johnson Space Center. Jack hired Ted [Dr. Theodore A.] Talay, who once ran the Vehicle Analysis Branch at Langley Research Center. Ted is one of the world’s foremost authorities on space launch vehicles, deriving mass properties, costs and schedules, and running precision trajectories to see what they will do. The JSC team, including Mack, Jack and Ted, came up with the Side-Mount Shuttle-Derived Vehicle (SDV). The Shuttle Program Manager, John [P.] Shannon, has picked up on the Side-Mount and says he wants to do two things: continue to fly the Space Shuttle for a while and build the heavy-lift Side-Mount SDV to share the facilities at Michoud [Assembly Facility, New Orleans, Louisiana] and Kennedy Space Center [Florida].\\n\\n The Side-Mount Shuttle-Derived Vehicle was an awfully good idea 35 years ago. Today I think it’s time for us to move on and incentivize the private sector with an equivalent amount of money, which they say is $6.5 billion, but perhaps not to develop this thing, but rather to incentivize the private sector to build a fully reusable two-stage to orbit heavy lift vehicle to do the same job at much lower cost per flight. If we do that, I’m convinced we can get the launch cost down to something like $300 a pound from something like $8,000 to $10,000 a pound. It will enable this power satellite thing to come into being.\\n\\n That’s my crusade I’m on currently. I’m working with this small group of people at the Air Force that want to do it. One of the guys that’s in this group is right here in San Antonio. He’s become a friend. His name is Bob Lancaster. He was promoted from major to lieutenant colonel fairly recently and was kind enough to invite me to his promotion ceremony. He’s in charge of the Security Service Advance Planning Group. They’re the people that are interested in getting this niche market filled with energy from space rather than from diesel oil."

        "utterance": "Sure, and thanks for asking, Sandra. Appreciate it. When I came to NASA, I came from the flight test community and the flight test and development engineering background with the [U.S.] Marine Corps. In fact, I came from the Naval Air Systems Command. I had served as a test pilot on the Harrier Program, and also as a Chief Engineer for the Harrier Program at NAVAIR [Naval Air Systems Command] when I was invited to come to NASA. So as I got into flight operations and learning how to be a Shuttle crew member, I also got an opportunity to have some collateral duties that were in the other area of development and flight test matters and so on. So it was a real good education and a follow-up to what I had done before.\\n\\n Of course, NASA had some unique things in the way they do development and flight test from their own history, going back to Mercury and Gemini and Apollo. And in the early eighties it was nice to see some of the Apollo and even Gemini and Mercury people that were still there and talk to them about their history and the culture of NASA. A lot of it was very similar to what I was used to in aircraft flight test, but there were also some unique aspects to it that were very interesting to me and served me later on when I got out of pure flight [test] operations and got into some other jobs.\\n\\n I was in the Astronaut Office for eleven years, and as was the case with people that came when I did, it was punctuated, unfortunately, by the accident. My first flight in the Shuttle was shortly before the [Space Shuttle] Challenger [STS 51-L] accident, and my second flight was after the accident, so it gave me an opportunity to see some of the root cause things and to be able to participate in the recovery and the Return-to-Flight activity and to watch the agency as it learned from that catastrophe.\\n\\n I think that learning for me was important in that it kind of steered me towards flight safety even more strongly than I had been before I came to NASA. I had long since been a Safety Officer. When I was in the Marine Corps, I was in safety, a trained, certified Aviation Safety Officer. But when I got to NASA, I realized that that was an area that would be of great interest to me if I stayed with the agency after my flying days, and sure enough, that’s where I wound up. In this, what is my third assignment at NASA, I’m working in safety, reliability, and quality engineering, and I really enjoy that. I think it’s a good calling for anybody, and I appreciate the opportunity to serve in that way."

        "utterance": "Probably the most important thing to me is the distinction between flight operations and flight test operations. When we had the Challenger accident, there were people who looked at what happened and advised us. We looked at it ourselves. And I think it was a big realization to us that this thing was more dangerous and higher risk than we thought. There were things that we weren’t looking at hard enough. There were processes that we backed off on because we didn’t think that the risk required that kind of oversight and review.\\n\\n In retrospect, we were wrong, and that piece of the story, I think, hit us again on [Space Shuttle] Columbia [STS-107]. The Columbia accident, the board that looked at us thought that we were wrong to think of ourselves as purely operational, and that we were more of a flight test kind of an analogy. We should have more engineering oversight and more safety oversight, more government oversight of the contractor activities. When you look at that, I’d have to say that that’s a common set of learning that, unfortunately, we had to learn twice.\\n\\n When I look forward, and I occasionally hear people talk about we’re going to do a development activity with the new system and then we’ll be operational, it always raises a little yellow flag with me that, in fact, if I take it to the extreme, I could say that we’ll never be operational in the way I think of operations. When I was at the Naval Air Systems Command, we flew airplanes—when I was there it was the F-18 and the AV-8B Harrier, and those two airplanes went through a couple of thousand flights in a flight test environment before we gave them over to the fleet pilots to operate and declared them operational. That’s quite a few years to get those couple of thousand flights.\\n\\n I’m not saying that we need a thousand flights on a human-rated space system to make it operational, but I am saying that it does take a while, and it takes a lot of experience and a lot of tests. We’re still learning on Shuttle to this day how it really operates in the environment it’s in, flying the mission it flies, and we’re somewhere where I would think of as mid to late flight test on the Space Shuttle today. We’re certainly not operational the way I remember it.\\n\\n So that’s why I say the yellow flag comes up when I hear people talk about operations. I think the bad implication of operations is that it’s okay to back off and not watch what you’re doing too much. Everything is all clear; procedures and the techniques are all well established and tried and true, and you’re not getting hit by surprises very often. I just don’t know that we’ll get there anytime soon with the new systems, and we ought to keep our eyes open and act more like a flight test community for the foreseeable future."

The equipment that we’re using, we’re not using high-tech, new technology. We’re using proven stuff,” and so on. I see that as a path towards convincing ourselves once again as we have several times in the past that we’re different; that maybe we’re above and beyond the lessons learned in the past because of differences. And I see similarities.\\n\\n So maybe I’m a “glass half empty” kind of guy here when it comes to this, but I don’t blame the folks at NASA. They’re can-do folks. They’ve got a great attitude about the future, about discovery, about their systems they’re developing. That’s all wonderful. I just sometimes get a little bit concerned that we forget some of those lessons from the past, and that’s something that we need to keep in mind as we go forward."

Now, each of those functions has different aspects to it. Safety, for example, includes industrial and occupational safety for the workforce in their day-to-day jobs. It also includes systems safety engineering as a discipline in the engineering community.\\n\\n Now, for years and years NASA—in fact, ever since the Apollo fire—NASA has decided that they would separate out safety and reliability engineering from the Engineering organizations and put them under a separate organization. They’re still engineering disciplines, but they’re under separate organizations. Usually it’s called Safety and Mission Assurance. I think there’s one or two of the [NASA] Centers that have a slightly different term for it, because they have Environmental or they have Occupational Health.\\n\\n But basically the system safety and reliability and quality engineers in the agency fall under my functional leadership as well as those who do pure assurance and verification of procedures. So we’re not just the checkers; we’re also people who are actively involved in the design and the development work with our people. So I think maybe that helps to capture some of the scope of what we are responsible for."

        "utterance": "When I first came to the agency, this office did not exist here, but it did at the Centers. Every Center had a Safety—and they used to call them a variety of things. At the Johnson Space Center [Houston, Texas] it was called the Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance, SR&QA. At some point the m word came in there, Safety, Reliability, Maintainability, and Quality Assurance.\\n\\n Most of the Centers had similar titles to these offices. They were a vestige of the post-Apollo time frame when the safety engineering and the reliability engineering functions were put into those independent offices for a check and balance. The check and balance was meant not to be simply with the programs and the projects at the Centers, but also with engineering. So the safety folks would look to the Engineering organization, as part of their scope, as well as the projects that were at the Center.\\n\\n The reason I mention that is that you’ll find that some other aerospace companies and government organizations, that the Safety Engineer and especially the Reliability Engineer may not actually be in a separate Safety organization. They may be assigned to the Engineering organization as divisions of Engineering. There are other places, in fact, the one I came from, the Naval Air Systems Command, where the Safety Engineer wore two hats; reported to two different organizations. They reported to the Chief Engineer or the Engineering Director at the Systems Command. But they also had a separate reporting line to an independent Safety organization.\\n\\n The reason they did that was similar to the reason that we came up with ourselves after the Apollo fire, was that the Safety Engineer needs to have a check-and-balance function over all the other engineering that’s going on; not just worry about their hazard reports, for example, that they’re being done on time or whatever, but to also be able to step back and assure themselves that the safety aspects of the other engineering disciplines were being carried out properly, and that’s why they needed an independent path. Didn’t want the Safety Engineer to be drowned out and maybe a Safety Engineer input left out with no alternative route, so that’s why they had it that way.\\n\\n At NASA we went a step further, and we actually took them out of Engineering and put them in the Safety and Mission Assurance organization. Now, the name Safety and Mission Assurance came about after the Challenger accident, where we had a variety of names in the agency. We were adding “-ilities” to the function, like Maintainability, in some cases, Survivability or things like that. The titles got so long that we decided to just keep it shorter by using the word Mission Assurance to capture all the other things, including quality; quality engineering, reliability, and maintainability.\\n\\n That’s different from the Defense Department [Department of Defense (DoD)]. In the Defense Department, Mission Assurance captures different kind of things, and we sometimes will confuse our friends in the DoD because of that. But here at NASA Mission Assurance was a term to capture all the other “-ilities” other than safety and just make the title shorter.\\n\\n The other thing that happened after the Challenger accident was that the Challenger Mishap Board, the Rogers Commission, dedicated one of their ten recommendations to the fact that we did not have an independent Safety and Mission Assurance organization here at Headquarters like we did at all the Centers. In fact, the Safety Engineer at Headquarters, the Reliability and the Quality Engineers at Headquarters, were basically assigned to the Chief Engineer’s Office here at NASA Headquarters.\\n\\n So they thought that was a disconnect, that there ought to be a separate Safety and Mission Assurance organization here just like we had at the Centers, and that we should have functional ownership of the safety, reliability, and quality disciplines under an Associate-Administrator-level manager reporting directly to the Administrator. So we invented what was then called Code Q and now is called the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance."

        "utterance": "From the beginnings of this Office of Safety and Mission Assurance shortly after Challenger till now, I haven’t seen much change in general scope and function. We have leadership and policy and directional oversight of these “-ilities” that we call Safety and Reliability and Quality. So that means we are responsible for directives, the NPDs [NASA Policy Directive], NPRs [NASA Procedural Requirement], those things that we call our directive system, standards that are used, and so on. About a third of the people that I have here in Washington deal with that every day, updating the standards, which we try to update every five years our policy directives, and that keeps them busy, because we own about fifty or so of these directives.\\n\\n We also, as part of our functional oversight, do audits and assessments out of Headquarters here and try to keep track of what’s going on in the Mission Directorates and at the Centers, so that I’m aware of that and can participate in the reviews for those things that come to the agency for top-level decisions, like, for example, launches and major programs and so on. So those functions have not really changed very much. Some of the things we’re doing about those functions have changed a little bit, but the functions themselves have been the same.\\n\\n There have been several groups that have come in as late as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board that have recommended that we actually have more operational leadership of the things that are going on at the Centers and in the programs and projects, and relieve the Centers of those responsibilities that they’ve had all these years. Functional leadership is not the same as operational management, and there are people who every now and then will come in and suggest that we combine those two, and that all the safety people, for example, that work on programs and projects should actually be reporting operationally to me, and that I would handle their budget.\\n\\n Every time we look at this question—we understand why it comes up, and it’s not unique to our organization that this kind of undelegating suggestion occasionally comes up, or centralization. But every time we’ve looked at it, we’ve decided that no, we think it’s better to allow a Center Director, for example, to own and manage the Safety and Mission Assurance people at their Center as part of the Center’s job in hosting and providing the technical authority for the programs and projects that are at that Center; the same with Engineering.\\n\\n So we do occasionally challenge that notion, but so far we’ve decided to pretty much keep it the same, and so I’d have to say it hasn’t really changed too much over the years."

That’s why we’ve kind of kept it that way.\\n\\n I’m sure we’ll look at this again as time goes on, but so far—with one exception, and that is major programs like Shuttle and Space Station, the Center Director, per se, as an authority, does not have technical authority over programs that are hosted at their Center, just projects. So when you go down to a program review in Houston for the Space Shuttle, for example, you’ll see a OSMA placard at that review, and although the person wears a JSC badge, they are exercising technical authority that’s a Headquarters authority at that meeting. But when you go to an Orbiter project meeting or any of the projects that you see at Goddard [Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland] or JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California], the Center Directors have the technical authority for project oversight."

I think that our community needs to be smart enough to be an active member of any design or development team, and not just a policeman. They need to be aware of what the safety requirements are and be very familiar with them, but they also need to be smart enough to understand those things in the context of the design as a whole.\\n\\n Now, it’s hard to find a Safety Engineer that knows all about the entire integrated story, but they have a community back in their organization that does. So you may have a Safety Engineer who turns out to be a propulsion expert and is a little weaker on electrical; that’s fine, as long as they know where to go to get electrical help in the Safety organization. And they need to be “yes if” kind of attitude, not a “no because” attitude. It’s a little easier to be “no because.” “No, you can’t do that because it violates this standard,” for example. It’s a little harder to be a “yes if.” “Yes, you can do it that way if you come up with an equivalency for this standard that you’re going to have to violate.” That’s the kind of attitude they need to have.\\n\\n I think that’s most helpful to the designers. Standards and rules and regulations were all based on lessons learned from the past, so we need to give them credit and understand why they’re there, but we also need to realize that it would be virtually impossible to design, develop, and operate a system that meets every rule we got. We’re going to have to find ways around some of those regulations and rules, by definition.\\n\\n The Space Shuttle, for example, had some requirements for reliability, and it had to find its way around them several thousand times with its design. We call those “waivers” or a “critical items list” and those sorts of things. With the kind of work we do, we have to make sure that if and when that happens, we’ve got to have a safety and a reliability and a quality community that can help the designers figure out the best ways to deal with these things.\\n\\n We’re not there yet. In this agency we have a Safety and Mission Assurance community that is very good. In fact it’s a lot better than what I had in the government ranks when I was at the Naval Air Systems Command as far as their training and their education and their understanding of what’s going on. But we can also improve ourselves, and we can become better at our disciplines and we can be better systems engineers as a whole and help us move forward in Constellation."

In order to get us to that next step of competence we need to do some things, and some of those will cost some money and some resources and training and so on. The Chief Engineer is in the same boat. He’s trying to improve the engineering excellence in the agency as a whole for all the disciplines, and we’re sort of following in his footsteps there.\\n\\n We’re also creating a NASA Safety Center up at Glenn Research Center [Cleveland, Ohio]. Right outside the gate there is a facility that’s the home of our new NASA Safety Center. That Safety Center will have a big role in helping improve the training and the qualifications of our people to where we can get to that next step, and that will probably cost a few million bucks which we haven’t had in our budget in the past, and we’ll need to step up to that.\\n\\n Now, I think we’re spending pretty much a bare minimum on other things that we have to do as well, so that means a little bit more money will probably be required, and the agency has told us that they expect that and will deal with it. Doubling my budget is not a good idea. I wouldn’t know what to do with all that. Certainly improving today’s posture a little bit so we can get a better handle on agency-wide technical excellence is in the works."

Class-Bs are what you do when you have damage to hardware in excess of $250,000 or an injury to personnel that requires that they go to the hospital. Class-A is when you have a million dollar damage or a serious injury or incapacitation or death.\\n\\n Like I said, we had thirty-one of those in a two-year period, and each of those boards was a three- to five-member board. Each of them had a Chair that depended more or less on members of the board to help them navigate themselves through our mishap investigation process.\\n\\n It takes a lot to do a good mishap investigation board, a lot of good engineering, a lot of good analysis, and very good communication skills in the way of findings, recommendations, and writing a good report, and it takes time. Some of our boards struggled with the thing, not necessarily just because it was a difficult technical challenge to find out what happened and get to root cause, but because the tools and techniques for developing your root cause analysis can take a lot of time and effort.\\n\\n Frankly, some of them struggled more than they needed to just because they hadn’t done it before, and they hadn’t really sat down and gone through the thinking that goes into findings and recommendations. So they spent an awful lot of time writing their report. The technical part was easy for the engineering team that they had, but the writing of the report was hard, because it’s not the normal kind of report that they’re used to writing.\\n\\n All those difficulties that they had, I think they could use some help in the way of experience, facilitation, and advice. One of the things we will call for our Safety Center to do is to have a small staff of people who are very good at mishap investigation, especially that last part, the development of the findings, recommendations, and the writing of the report, so that each team doesn’t have to learn this on their own the hard way. They can have someone there to advise them and help them get through that. I think that will cut down the amount of time it takes to do these reports and improve the standardization across the board. So we’re talking about four or five, maybe six, people that would be dedicated to mishap investigation support for the agency."

You can look at the old Spinoff magazines that we used to put out and see all kinds of things that technology brought to the fore, but there’s also some process things. I couldn’t tell you that we invented some of these processes that I’ve been impressed with, but we certainly have taken them on and made good use of them, like process failure mode and effect analysis was something that our [Morton] Thiokol [Incorporated] folks developed on the solid rocket motors.\\n\\n That’s an excellent mission assurance process that doesn’t just look at the design of the hardware; it looks at the process that people are using to build a motor or build a nozzle, for example. It uses a process similar to what you do in a design to look for single-failure points in your process where you might then solve the problem by adding an inspection or an independent oversight function of some sort. That process, I think, has improved the reliability of the product that comes out the back end of that process. I know that there are other people now using it outside of the agency for their own purposes.\\n\\n Now, we tend to beat ourselves up and get advice from our own mishap investigations on where our failings are, but we also have people calling all the time asking us how we do this, that, and the other, looking to benchmark NASA on how it does safety practices.\\n\\n We have a pretty good record in the government for industrial and occupational safety across our Centers. Part of that is because we have stepped up to the Voluntary Protection Program, VPP, which is an OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] process, which basically gets the leadership much more involved and improves the discipline on your [operational] hazard analysis and your [incident] reporting. Those things have given us a big improvement in our mishap statistics for slips, trips, falls, industrial and occupational safety matters.\\n\\n So I think there’s been some impact there, because we’ve had other agencies and other companies come and look at us to see what it is we’re doing and have taken some of those lessons back. We like to benchmark other people, too, but we find ourselves as a subject, or an object, of a benchmark every now and then."

        "utterance": "Well, maybe I’m too simplistic about it. Being a Marine, I guess maybe that’s what comes with that background. But we’re one of the few agencies that has an and in our title. You know, Food and Drug; they can’t just do one or the other. Their whole charter says you do both, and so does ours. Aeronautics and Space, that’s what we were set up for. If they take the and out of there and get rid of aeronautics, then we won’t do it anymore. But as long as we have that and in there, I think we owe it to the public, and it just goes back to the beginnings. There’s a lot of discussion about is it going away. Well, it can’t really, unless we go change our charter.\\n\\n Do we need to do more? Yes, sure, but it takes resources. There will always be a balance in there of what’s the appropriate amount. I think Lisa Porter working with other government agencies and the White House recently was instrumental in establishing a framework for how the government deals with aeronautics research and development, and our role in that is going to be very pivotal and important in doing advanced research stuff. Not so much the prototype work we used to do; more basic research, and that’s great. Somebody needs to do that, and that’s an important part of aeronautics."

        "utterance": "Well, in the job I’m in I tend to focus on lessons learned that had to do with failures and how we recovered from them. I guess that’s part of the nature of this job. I sometimes refer people in my community and in the engineering community to a book by a fellow named [Henry] Petrovski called To Engineer Is Human. In that book his basic premise is that all the great engineering advances throughout history tended to come from recovering well from failures. Not to say that every time there was a failure, people recovered well from it. Sometimes people ignored failures, and so they didn’t get any learning from them. But when you have a failure, you owe it to yourself, the people who may have suffered in the failure, and the future, to learn as much as you can about why it happened and how to avoid it in the future.\\n\\n So I tend to look at things like the Apollo fire, the failures we’ve had in our space flight, you know the Atlas failure with lightning back in 1987—twenty years ago this month, in fact—the human space flight failures that we’ve had, failures in operations where we lost people in aircraft, and some of the mission failures we’ve had in our robotics programs, and I worry that we will lose some of those lessons. I worry a little bit about how we capture lessons learned. I think we have a lot to do there to make sure we don’t lose those.\\n\\n This office several years ago, in worrying about that—this is before I got here—developed a system called Lessons Learned Information System, LLIS. As you know, every two or three years any kind of database or computer program software you come up with to do anything is pretty much outmoded, and it’s the same with the LLIS. It was a great thing to do. It was meant to solve part of that problem on not losing our lessons learned. When you look at it today, you say, “We’ve got to do better than that.” It’s not searchable like we’d like it to be. It’s not using the latest technology and so on.\\n\\n I’m a believer in lessons learned not just being in a database or in a book somewhere, but also in the day-to-day operations, the procedures, the design requirements, the standards that we have. Those things need to capture our lessons learned. That’s how we would not lose them.\\n\\n An example is I mentioned the Atlas failure, struck by lightning. Well, that lesson had been learned in Apollo. Apollo 12 was struck by lightning. There was a lot of work in developing the science and understanding of triggered lightning, which is a phenomenon that shows up much more in [launch vehicles] with long ionized plumes coming out of them than it would in aircraft, where it’s not a big deal. But from the Apollo experience there was a lot of learning and lessons that came out of that, and yet a few years later in 1987 we were struck by triggered lightning and lost the payload and the Atlas rocket.\\n\\n In retrospect you’d say we failed to learn that lesson. It turns out that when you go back and look at that accident investigation, you find that there was a rule in the rule book, the launch commit criteria, that dealt with that. It said don’t launch in clouds that are a certain depth with the freezing layer going through them. But there was a lack of understanding by the launch team about why that was there, what it was for. It’s not clear from reading the transcripts that they even knew that that rule had anything to do with triggered lightning, because they were asking questions about icing and so on.\\n\\n So you could say that we had imperfect capture of lessons learned there, and that that was part of the root cause of that accident. That’s the kind of stuff I worry about."

        "utterance": "Sure. Things like when we develop our lessons learned from accidents and failures, that we find homes for those things that include not only the lesson itself but some reference to show you where it came from and why it’s there so that people understand that that’s not something you can violate, you can waive, without discussing and understanding why it’s there. Just putting the rule in there doesn’t necessarily prevent people in the future from having a problem.\\n\\n Human nature is such that in the “yes if” modus that I told you about, yes, you can do this if you can come up with an approach that matches that rule that you’re trying to waive or deviate from. I know that’s going to happen in the future. We’re not a rule-driven organization, and when people do challenge the rules and the regulations, they need to do it from a knowledge base that captures the real lesson learned, not just what the rule says, but why it’s there and why it got there in the first place. That’s a lot of effort to put a system like that into place.\\n\\n There are people who have done it well. The Mission Operations people in Houston, for example, have, because of the Atlas accident, which was not a human space flight thing. But because of that accident the Mission Operations people in Houston decided that from now on the flight rules that we live by for human space flight will have not just the rule but a little italicized rationale behind that rule right in there with the book so that everybody reading that rule will see why it’s there.\\n\\n It’s hard to capture the entire why. Sometimes the why it’s there could be a volume. But in two or three sentences they capture the essence of it and maybe a reference to something else. That’s the way they tried to deal with that lesson learned.\\n\\n There are other ways to do it. Training, of course, is a big piece of that, making sure that people who are qualified as operators understand the rules they live with, not just what they are but why they’re there.\\n\\n Anyway, all that stuff is important, and it’s one of the things that I worry about as much as anything."

        "utterance": "I think the NASA Values statement helps a little bit with that, the Core Values, which over the last ten years have pretty much been about three or four items, integrity, safety, excellence, and teamwork. Different words, maybe, have defined them in the various strategic plans and so on, but those four things are things that NASA people tend to strive for. They have a keen sense of awareness of safety. The Snoopy Program and the Space Flight Awareness Program, for example, are great examples of how NASA people really do worry about the people they strap into the spacecraft, and the same with the airplane community. That’s a cultural thing that I noticed when I first came to this agency.\\n\\n The integrity and the excellence, when you talk to NASA people, they take pride in their work, and they take pride in the integrity of their work. If they can’t trust somebody in the chain of command, for example, they take offense at that, because they believe that integrity is important in this agency, and somebody that maybe is walking on the edge of an integrity issue or an ethical issue really bothers NASA people. That shows up as a cultural aspect that I appreciate.\\n\\n I know Steven [J.] Dick just did the culture survey, and one of the things that really bothered us when we heard about that was that there’s a higher than comfortable segment of our NASA population who believes that there’s an integrity issue with their leadership, for example. “Can you trust your leadership?” I think is the way the question came out, and it didn’t come out 100 percent yes. When it doesn’t come out 100 percent yes, we in the agency worry about that.\\n\\n Now, just because something is a Core Value doesn’t mean we’re there. It does mean something that we value, though, and I sense that."
