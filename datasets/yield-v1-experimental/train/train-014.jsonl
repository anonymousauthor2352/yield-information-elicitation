There are several people who were selected out, one of whom was a man named Conrad Hirsch, who was probably one of the brightest and most creative of the volunteers. I don't know firsthand why he was selected out, but there were three, two or three reasons given in rumors around the campus. One was that he went to Reed College, which was quite liberal. Another was that he had a beard and none of the rest of us did in those days. I later did.\n\nAnd the third was that he had actually lived with a woman he was not married to. So my understanding was that he was selected out because somebody decided he wasn't going to be a desirable volunteer. When we finally got to Ethiopia, it was several days later, Conrad was already there and he became one of the best volunteers. I don't know how he got back into the Peace Corps, but it worked. When we left UCLA and flew to St. Louis and Kansas City to say goodbye to our families, we sold my car, which was a car that I'd inherited from my family, a little Ford Falcon.

That changed gradually where we wound up with an ESA Control Center, a JAXA Control Center, and the Russians sitting in Russia. They won’t come here. We’re interacting with those people. That happened over time. I think it was not as much of a culture shock because it happened over time. The more recent element, when we canceled the Constellation Program and the administration’s decision was to put more emphasis on commercial vendors, which I personally think is a great idea, the reality I think of you can’t own it all yourself anymore started settling in.\\n\\n You really had two choices. Either you got with the new program or you went and found yourself something else to do.

That machine had the whatever they call the—it didn’t have this kind of printing. [Demonstrates] Now, let me see. Yes. Yes, it did. I forget what they call this kind of printing. The newspaper printing is different from what that is, because every time you made a mistake—if you had a capital M, and you wanted it to be an N, you had to know exactly how many backspaces you had to go. How many–one, two, three, four, five. Okay, cut that out. Then you’d hit N, and that would only take four, say. That’s executive type; I think that’s what they called the executive type.\\n\\n Anyway, I was issued this electric IBM machine, the first, and let me tell you, even with a felt pad this thick [demonstrates], with a typewriter on it, on a metal base, noisy.

I think the accident, though, the fire, caused the crews to be more vocal about concerns that they might have had in—prior to the fire but not as—expressed as—perhaps as strongly as they would have expressed them afterwards. So, I think the program saw a rededication, also, and a—more of an inclination to be vocal about things that the crews would view as a safety concern.\\n\\n So, I think it was there all along. I mean, I think both the people on the ground, the engineering teams, the designers, the safety and reliability people, all tried to do the best they could at—before, and during, and afterwards. And I think what we saw, also, was that the crew became more vocal and more willing to jump into a subject and rattle it around in order to be sure that they were satisfied.

And who knows what’s going to happen to the Shuttle system.\\n\\n But you didn’t have the accusations of criminality and the moral stuff, and the stuff that was really heart-wrenching, other than, obviously—and please don’t make it sound like I’m not saying that it wasn’t heart-wrenching to see what happened to the families and the people and those—and they’re wonderful people who died, and all that. But the extra stuff that was going on that was sort of the extracurricular stuff out of Challenger was much, much greater.\\n\\n I think that part of it’s just it’s the second one, and I think the country has become more inured and are probably a little harder now, and less empathetic.

One of the things is that being computerized helped things an awful lot because you could search on a computer and find out if you had a record on file rather quickly and then you could go and get it. Otherwise, you had to get a name and walk out there and find it alphabetically or numerically and that took a little more time. Sometimes with records where, for example, if you had Navy, you had a medical and you had a personnel record. Sometimes if you needed them both, you had to go to two different files to get it.
